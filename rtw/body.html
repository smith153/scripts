What Marriage Is and Isn't, Part 2 of 4 (Fighting for Your Family)
When two people consider marriage, they're often in a fog of being in love. Faults in the other party are overlooked. It is only after the rice is thrown that reality sets in. Today we review more misconceptions about marriage and how to make it work God's way.

What Marriage Is and Isn't, Part 1 of 4 (Fighting for Your Family)
A family should be a source of support and safety. Some families hide dark secrets of shame, as dads have not been the kind of fathers their wives and kids deserve. Hear why it is necessary to forgive your father so that, with God's help, you can live your life in freedom.

Rising crime and divorce rates bear sad testimony to families with poor male role models or none at all. It is vital that dads lead their families in the right direction. The next generation depends on it, and right now the outlook is grim.

Society confuses the natural roles of men and women. Many people want men to feel that it is wrong to be masculine. The result is that families have either weak husbands or no husbands at all.

The enemies of the heterosexual family invariably deny the fundamental differences between the genders. This makes it easier for "Heather" to have "two mommies." Yet the Bible teaches that kids need both moms and dads.

The Psalmist cried out, "If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?" (11:3). The family is under attack by the devil and his political cohorts, all determined to destroy marriage, your kids, and the moral values taught in the Scriptures.

It's unthinkable that two plus two could ever equal five. But more unthinkable are recent Supreme Court decisions in America, The Defense of Marriage Act? Unconstitutional.

Every major policy shift from government leaves a trail of implications, some for good, but sadly, many for evil. The US Supreme court has bowed to interest groups and found gay marriage as valid as heterosexual marriage. The damage this will do to the youth of America is a story yet untold.

Christ the Gift of Liberty, Part 3 of 3 (Christ God's Gift at Christmas)
We can be so deep in bondage to sin that we don't even realize it. That's why we need the truth to set us free. Jesus not only knows the truth, He is the truth, and He wants to set you free from slavery to sin. That's the great liberation we all need, made possible only because God the Father sent the gift of His Son into the world.

Real freedom is not doing whatever you want, whenever you want. Rather, it's doing the will of God. That's freedom without regrets. To run life's race, we need to know where we're going. Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life." Freedom starts with truth, and truth is embodied in Jesus Christ. At Christmas we remember that Truth was born into the world, and that Truth can set us free.

When Jesus said, "You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free," He made possible the ultimate kind of freedom. True freedom has its roots in truth, and Christ said "I am the truth." For all among us trapped in addictions and oppression, Christ's gift of liberty is ours to take.

At Christmas, we recall the light shining over Bethlehem and the birth of the One who brings light into our lives. The prophet Isaiah wrote "arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord rises upon you." He looked forward to the coming of Jesus, and we can now look back to that wondrous day when He was born into this world.

God loved all of mankind enough to send the greatest gift of all. As we run the last mile of the Christmas race, let's not forget the gift of God's Son, without Whom there would be no Christmas. That gift was the ultimate expression of love: the best God could offer to an undeserving human race.

We expend a lot of energy buying Christmas presents with traffic and parking hassles, and braving those big shopping crowds all for the joy of seeing a loved one open a gift. God wants us to open His gift of love just as badly as we want our kids to open theirs. That gift was offered first as a baby, but ultimately on a cross, that we might be reconciled to the Father.

As a Christian, do you share your faith? We who have eternal life often forget the emptiness in those who don't. Christmas is the ideal time to slow down life's race long enough to share Christ with friends who need Him. Just as Jesus was born into the world, He wants to be born into the hearts of all who will receive Him.

People search for meaning in all kinds of places, but all of them lead to a dead end except Jesus.

Many people are fearful for what tomorrow may bring. Dark days loom on the horizon, and uncertainty is spreading. Finding the will of God is a lifelong quest, and we need to seek Him first before the details of life come into focus. When they do, we'll know that we've found the right road.

Your church needs you. It needs you out on life's racetrack, running alongside the other members to get the job done together. At times of deepening crisis, our challenge is to "get involved." That's what Esther did at a crucial point in the history of the Jewish people. She got involved even at great personal risk, as must we to face daunting challenges in the days ahead.

Most of our choices don't affect world history. But sometimes God puts us in situations where they can - and do.

She knew that, at that key moment, "the buck stopped here."

Today we learn about one such leader, a woman named Esther.

Sin is at the core of all marriage problems. In our self-focus, we often do not love our mates as we should. Many marriages begin happily but quickly descend into conflict. This is when husband and wife display the latent rebellion that characterizes every human since the first couple. Today we will learn how to apply God's solution to man's deepest problem and heal broken relationships.

Adam and Eve had it made in the Garden of Eden. But they tossed paradise aside, as each of us would have, when they disobeyed God. Like them, we find ways to manipulate each other to meet our own needs, not realizing that meeting our mate's needs is the real key to marital happiness. Feelings of rejection set in, as Adam and Eve's story repeats again and again down through history.

Despite counseling, divorce marks the end of half of American marriages, leaving behind incalculable damage. When the family unit breaks down, culture itself breaks down. Communication breakdowns affect nearly every marriage at one time or another, and this began quite early in history - all the way back to the Garden of Eden.

Left to ourselves, we're basically narcissistic. We would much rather meet our own needs than meet the needs of others. In matrimony, two people have to care for each other.

Anyone who thinks that marriage is the magic door to happiness might want to note that half of all marriages fail today.

Many marriages are on shaky ground. Some see their mates like car models; trade them in when a better one comes along. The underlying issue is covetousness, wanting what you do not have.

In the old days, it was said, "his word is as good as his bond." A handshake and a promise was all it took to seal the deal. These days, when a marriage breaks up, we have prenuptial agreements to divvy up the loot. Few take seriously the covenant they enter into when they tie the knot and exchange the rings. Today, Pastor Lutzer explains why marriage, in God's eyes, is a lifetime deal no matter what.

Building a Lasting Marriage, Part 3 of 3 ('Til Death Do Us Part)
Commitment is a fast-fading part of modern marriage, where "irreconcilable differences" mean divorce is around the corner.

The High Cost of Sexual Purity, Part 4 of 4 (Guard Your Heart)
In the ongoing battle for our hearts, the bad guys seem to be winning. The media and our computers are paving the way. Every one of us is susceptible to moral sin. Since all of us have access to the internet, we are more susceptible than ever. Our entire culture is sinking into a pit of moral decay. The issue is serious and demands a radical solution.

The High Cost of Sexual Purity, Part 3 of 4 (Guard Your Heart)
The Biblical standard for sexual morality is very high, so high that many people think it is unattainable. The Sermon on the Mount gives us the ideal in morality: a deep, heartfelt desire to do the will of God and to renounce sin. The bottom line? None of us can keep this standard on our own. We need the kind of help Jesus provides as our Savior and Redeemer.

Addictions are devastating. They distort personalities, ruin family relationships, and put people in defense mode. People with addictions usually insist that they have no addiction. They ignore attempts to help them. Today we will look at more of the characteristics of an addict to help us understand how addiction begins, and, how its curse can be lifted.

The internet offers pornography to anyone who wants to access it. This inflames desires and leads to sex addiction. That is a good reason why the Bible tells us to guard our hearts. Today, we probe the mind of an addict to see what leads a person there, and what steps we should take to be free of an addiction fueled by the easy availability of images on our computers.

It all begins with the click of a mouse and the flame of sexual desire is fanned. Each believer has a choice to make. The Bible tells us to "touch not the unclean thing." We need to make choices that honor God, and where that mouse pointer goes is a choice we have to make every day.

When you have two oxen pulling a plow, you need both to work together. Otherwise, you cannot plow in a straight line. That is why the Bible says "don't be unequally yoked together" in any binding relationships. There is a need for separation from the world, a separation that keeps us from being contaminated.

There is no doubt. It's a mess out there. The moral impurity in the media and on the internet is destroying a whole generation. Christians are torn.

The grace of God is His unmerited favor, His bestowal of mercy on those who don't deserve it. That includes all of us. No matter how far we have fallen, there is help and hope if we come to God in honest repentance, seeking His forgiveness and healing. Many who have been in deep moral sin now have this hope. Today, you will hear a testimony of one man who found that God's grace was enough.

Despite their best intentions, even Christians fall into sin. It's easy with today's media technology. When we fall, we're tempted to give up, to let the world have its way.

The Gift of Spiritual Fruit, Part 2 of 4 (When the Spirit Has His Way)
Christians have an inner conflict. They are fighting against the desires of the flesh that are against the desires of the Holy Spirit. So as we learn to walk in the Spirit, following the prompts given to us by God, we'll not give in to the desires of the flesh.

The Gift of Spiritual Fruit, Part 1 of 4 (When the Spirit Has His Way)
When a Christian is walking in the Spirit, their everyday life is marked by visible evidence of the presence of God: love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. These are the fruits of the Spirit and they're in stark contrast to the behavior of many who don't know God. In today's message, we'll see the difference between the works of the flesh and the works of the Spirit.

The Gift of Service, Part 4 of 4 (When the Spirit Has His Way)
There are all kinds of people in the body of Christ with all kinds of strengths and all kinds of weaknesses--and all kinds of needs to be met. That's why the Holy Spirit bestows spiritual gifts on those who believe: to help each other. The gifts are as diverse as those who receive them. And, each one is critical if the body is to function as God intends.

The Gift of Service, Part 3 of 4 (When the Spirit Has His Way)
Some believers are reluctant to focus on the Holy Spirit because they think it means having to speak in tongues. This gift of the Spirit was prevalent at the birth of the church, and today its resurgence causes some to wonder if what we see now is the same thing that happened long ago. In today's message, Pastor Lutzer takes a careful look into the Bible for clarity on what tongues are and what they're not.

The Gift of Service, Part 2 of 4 (When the Spirit Has His Way)
Every believer has a gift they can use to serve the body of Christ. Some teach, some exhort, some serve, some manage. Our gifts may vary, but the Holy Spirit bestows at least one gift on each of God's people. In today's message, Pastor Lutzer will help us discern what our gift is.

The Gift of Service, Part 1 of 4 (When the Spirit Has His Way)
Every Christian is indwelt with the Holy Spirit. Every believer is part of the Body of Christ: the Church. We're created to function within the Body, and God, through His Holy Spirit, has given all of us gifts in order to do so.

The Gift of Sensitivity, Part 3 of 3 (When the Spirit Has His Way)
When the Spirit has His way in a Christian's life, their consciences become more tuned in to right and wrong. The process of becoming Christ-like involves a growing sensitivity to the Holy Spirit who wants to create in us the character of Jesus, so that sins that seemed insignificant suddenly seem big, and our desire to please God means more to us that pleasing ourselves.

The Gift of Sensitivity, Part 2 of 3 (When the Spirit Has His Way)
The Bible tells us that the devil loves to instigate anger because it's destructive. We're told to not give the devil an opportunity. But did you know that the Holy Spirit can help us when anger seems the only alternative? In today's message, learn more about becoming sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit.

The Gift of Sensitivity, Part 1 of 3 (When the Spirit Has His Way)
The Holy Spirit is very sensitive, that's why He is usually depicted as a gentle dove. He will not force Himself upon us so we must become attuned to Him so that we don't grieve Him. Because when we grieve the Spirit of God, it makes it difficult for Him to bless us.

The Gift of Security, Part 3 of 3 (When the Spirit Has His Way)
Believers in Christ are sealed by the Holy Spirit, and that seal is a down-payment on the eternal life yet to come. As God's property, we're on the road toward a future kingdom, and the Holy Spirit makes this real to all who are born again. But don't assume that you have the seal of the Spirit. Make sure that you do. Today's message tells you how you can be sure.

As believers in Christ, we know we're in God's hands and that we'll make it to the very end. God has sealed us with the Holy Spirit, and He's the only one who can break that seal. So though life may be hard, there are no permanent tragedies. We belong to the Almighty, and we belong to Him forever.

The Gift of Purity, Part 4 of 4 (When the Spirit Has His Way)
Moral purity is not easy, especially since our tendency (and our culture) tells us to gratify our desires. People will defend poor moral choices with a thousand excuses. But believers in Christ have the Holy Spirit, and if we follow His leading, He'll convict us when our thoughts turn where they shouldn't.

God sees every motivation and watches every act. This should help us keep intimacy where God intended it, and flee from any situation that might tempt us to defile our bodies. Our bodies, after all, are the temples of God's Holy Spirit.

As our culture becomes more saturated with "guiltless" immorality, it becomes harder to live a pure life. The Apostle Paul faced similar circumstances with the Corinthians who justified their ways, much as today's society does. Let's look at how Paul handled it.

When we don't acknowledge God; when we don't worship God; when we don't love the Lord with all of our hearts, minds and souls, we are living in sin. And the Holy Spirit has come to convict us of this sin, and of the danger facing us if we continue down that path.

The Gift of Community, Part 4 of 4 (When the Spirit Has His Way)
The coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost was a revolutionary moment. The newborn church was now alive and well, and those in Jerusalem couldn't help but notice the profound love these disciples shared. This new community was quickly making a mark on its culture, drawing many, and repelling others.

The Gift of Community, Part 3 of 4 (When the Spirit Has His Way)
The Holy Spirit binds believers together. Even when meeting someone you don't know, there's an intangible sense of fellowship when that person is a brother or sister in Christ. That sense of community is another evidence of the reality of the Holy Spirit.

The Gift of Community, Part 2 of 4 (When the Spirit Has His Way)
By looking at the early church, Pastor Lutzer shows us how, through the Holy Spirit, the Christians lived and spread the good news of the Gospel. Through the unity they all shared in the Spirit, there was a connectedness that gave them power. Their holy living caused the world to feel uncomfortable, and we would do well to follow their example.

The Gift of Community, Part 1 of 4 (When the Spirit Has His Way)
It's unfortunate that one of the most blessed teachings about the Holy Spirit has been a source of confusion for many people. The baptism of the Holy Spirit places all who believe in Jesus into a new community: a fellowship of those indwelt by the Spirit as evidence of their new birth in Christ. Some see the baptism as a special anointing whose mark is speaking in tongues--but what does the Bible say?

Jesus stood on a feast day and cried out to the crowd that those who believed in Him would experience rivers of living water in their souls. He didn't offer us a recipe. He offered a relationship--He offered Himself. That's an amazing invitation, one everyone should heed.

What water is to the body, the Holy Spirit is to our soul. Things of this world can't fill the emptiness we feel. We are actually seeking something beyond this world. And Jesus said that if anyone is thirsty, they should come to Him.

How gracious Jesus was to promise a companion who would be closer to us than even He was while on Earth. With the Holy Spirit as our permanent companion, our past has been forgiven and cleansed and our future is sealed, so there's nothing to fear in the present.

The Holy Spirit is not only with us, He is in us. When we sin, He is grieved. When we think that no one cares, He comforts us. When we can't pray because our circumstances are so dark, He prays on our behalf.

Jesus promised His disciples a companion who would be with them after He was gone. That companion was the Holy Spirit, and He's still doing for today's disciples what He did for the original twelve so long ago. So when you think that no one cares, the Holy Spirit is with you for fellowship and companionship. He will not leave you.

For those who have believed in Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit is in them and beside them as a helper, comforter and teacher. He's here to birth holiness in us and to keep us on a trajectory towards holiness. So if we let the Spirit have His way, He'll consume everything in our lives that isn't holy. He will purify us.

A Bad Man Made Good, Part 4 of 4 (Why Good People Do Bad Things)
Some philosophers see both good and evil in human nature. For them, the side that wins is determined by our environment. As much as we'd like to take credit for being basically nice people, only the new life implanted by God in the new birth can take a bad man and make him good.

If you think your sins are too big or too many, think about the Apostle Paul. He persecuted Christians--even to their deaths.

We are all sinners, yet we can be made good. Our desires can change, but they can only be changed by God. You need a love for Him, His word, and a love for others. You need a sense of brokenness and humility. These can only be implanted into your heart by God.

Jesus can deliver you from any addiction. God wants to deliver us from sin. He sent His Son to die so that we could experience freedom from sin.

The Roots of Rage, Part 1 of 4 (Why Good People Do Bad Things)
Everyone has been mad or angry at some point in their lives. Though it's okay to be angry, the Bible warns us not to sin when we're angered. When anger turns into rage--that's when the line has been crossed. In today's message we'll look at the source of this destructive emotion.

The Curse and Cure of Shame, Part 3 of 4 (Why Good People Do Bad Things)
If shame isn't dealt with, it can lead to paranoia and excessive perfectionism, or it can leave a person as nothing but a doormat for others. But God has a cure for shame. Hebrews 12:2 tells us that Jesus "endured the cross, scorning its shame..." or, put another way, "try to destroy Me if you can!"

In order to keep from falling into denial and even deception, we need to use the Word of God as our mirror. That's where we should go to find out who we are. Unlike a fun house mirror that distorts reality, the Word of God is unbent and will help us find a sense of identity.

The first mirror that reflects who we are is our parents. Teachers, coaches and the culture can influence us as well. And what they reflect back builds (or destroys) our perception of ourselves. Even at an early age, children discover that they can be one person on the outside and someone completely different inside. And that young, impressionable identity will determine our behavior: what we do and how we live.

All of this life is a preparation for the one to come. For the believer, this finite life will give way to an eternal one, and what God has prepared for those who have trusted Christ is beyond imagination. Not only will sorrows and pain cease, but we'll experience "joy inexpressible and full of glory." This message gives us a last look at perhaps the most important part of the invisible world: a place called heaven.

An angel declared that Jesus would "save His people from their sins." Since we can't save ourselves, that's really good news. If God didn't reach out to us, we'd never find Him on our own. In Zechariah 3, the angel of the Lord spoke of clean garments for the high priest, foreshadowing the robe of Christ's righteousness that admits us into heaven.

One of Satan's favorite tactics is to whisper to Christians, "See, you sinned! You're not worthy to get into heaven!" The truth Satan hides when he does this is that believers don't stand on their own records. They stand on the merits of Jesus. This allows us to deal with the guilt that often paralyzes us. Knowing our place in Christ means we can tell Satan to get lost.

Just because something is invisible doesn't mean it's not there. The air we breathe is invisible, and it's real. Angels are normally invisible as they do God's work on behalf of the redeemed. But sometimes, God lets us see them, as when Elisha confronted an enemy king's men.

It might be said that the church in America has never been as rich in wealth, while at the same time as poor in spiritual power. This indictment was handed down by Jesus to the ancient church at Laodicea. He may have had our day in mind when He said, "Because you say I'm rich...you don't know that you are wretched, miserable, blind and naked." So what remedy did He give them?

No one likes lukewarm food or beverages. Hot or cold is much better. Jesus said as much when evaluating the lukewarm Laodicean church in Revelation 3.

When Jesus Observes Our Reality, Part 2 of 3 (What Jesus Thinks of His Church)
Jesus is quite clear about his expectations for every local church. "Be watchful...hold fast what you've heard...repent...or else I will come upon you as a thief..." Though He said these words to an ancient church, could He be saying them to your church or mine?

When Jesus Observes Our Reality, Part 1 of 3 (What Jesus Thinks of His Church)
Self-delusion is easy. The addict says, "I can quit anytime," and believes it. Some churches think all is well because great numbers convince them God is doing a mighty work. Today, we'll visit an ancient church that Jesus proclaimed to be dead, even though it thought it was alive. Want a reality check for your church? Stay with us.

When Jesus Observes Our Holiness, Part 3 of 3 (What Jesus Thinks of His Church)
The eyes of the risen Jesus are like a flame of fire. They see through our excuses and identify those who have "overcome." Jesus mentions overcomers many times during his evaluations of seven ancient churches in the book of Revelation. Who they are and what they have overcome is our focus on today's broadcast.

When Jesus Observes Our Holiness, Part 2 of 3 (What Jesus Thinks of His Church)
It takes a lot of gall to celebrate sin and encourage it within the church, and yet this is exactly what happened at Thyatira. Jesus singled it out for words of judgment in the book of Revelation. It had a false prophetess who advocated sexual immorality and idolatry. Today's false prophets say they hear directly from God, but let's hear what Jesus thinks.

When Jesus Observes Our Holiness, Part 1 of 3 (What Jesus Thinks of His Church)
Mention "holiness" to many people, and they immediately envision someone locked up in a monastery or perhaps a convent, but holiness really means being "set apart" or separated from sin and unto God. This standard is not an option for God's children--He expects us to live pure lives. One of the seven churches Jesus addressed in Revelation was targeted for its failure to be holy.

Jesus commended churches that held fast to truth. In Revelation, He addressed seven local churches and in His letter to Pergamum, He spoke of those who "overcome." So, who are the overcomers? Can you and I be overcomers and receive the promises only overcomers can claim?

Teachers play a crucial role in the formation of our youth. In the same way, Bible teachers have enormous influence on members of a church. False doctrines can be easily spread. In today's message, Jesus tells an ancient church to reject the teachings He hates.

When Jesus Observes Our Teaching, Part 1 of 3 (What Jesus Thinks of His Church)
From the earliest days of the church, there has been a battle to protect the truth from an onslaught of false teaching. In the book of Revelation, Jesus singled out the church at Pergamum (in what is now Turkey). In the strongest terms, he decried their willingness to adopt false teachings advocating immorality. Could this happen today?

At Emmaus, the resurrected Jesus walked with disciples so dejected, so sorrowful that they did not even recognize Him. But their hearts were warmed by this passerby. Inviting Him to dinner, they found themselves face to face with the One they loved, but never really understood.

In the church of Jesus, persecution is assured, and there is no "Get Out of Jail Free" card. In fact, Jesus urges us to be faithful unto death, that we might obtain the crown of life. It's not a promise of health and wealth, but it is a promise of eventual triumph.

Is there anything you would give your life for? The early followers of Jesus often became martyrs. The word martyr simply means "witness."

"I have good news, and I have bad news." We've all heard this phrase before. Jesus had "news" for seven churches in the early chapters of the book of Revelation.

New Christians often have a radiant love for Jesus. Sadly, as time passes, that love sometimes cools. In the first century AD, Ephesus was a major city along the coast of what is now Turkey. Jesus commended the Ephesian church, but then chastised them for leaving their first love. What would He say about your church?

We learn from the book of Philippians that God has highly exalted Jesus, giving Him the name which is above every name.

Jesus then details His judgments on seven churches of that day.

We're all born with a propensity to sin and a desire to seek revenge whenever we're attacked, but vengeance is not something we have a right to. The Bible declares that "Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, says the Lord." So, how do we adjust our instincts to agree with the Scriptures?

Jesus never complained when He suffered. So why do we haul fellow believers into court when we think we've been cheated? Maybe it's because we think we can get justice from unbelieving judges. In reality, God wants us to get our justice from His hand. It's better to suffer a wrong than to tarnish the name of Jesus in a court of law.

Making sure you get justice is a big deal in the world's value system. That's why so many people file lawsuits.

We see how Jacob spent most of his life manipulating events to get what God had already promised--the older would serve the younger. But after Jacob confessed that he was a "cheater," God renamed him Israel. Sometimes God needs to humble us and bring us to a point of great need in order to reconcile us to Himself--and to others.

Faith at the Breaking Point, Part 3 of 4
In Revelation 13, the future Antichrist's power is on display, and slaughtering Christians is what he's doing. The Antichrist is known as the beast. He forces the whole world to worship him by using military and economic pressure. Without his mark, no one can buy or sell. Could any of us maintain our faith in Jesus during a time like this, when not worshiping the beast means death?

Faith at the Breaking Point, Part 2 of 4
In the Bible, the end-game for planet Earth is not a "tiptoe through the tulips." Rather, it's unimaginable war: a future Antichrist will arise and deceive the world into worshipping him. Anyone living at this time will face almost certain death unless they comply. Even now, believers face execution in many parts of the world. Could your faith survive in the face of oppression like this?

Faith at the Breaking Point, Part 1 of 4
According to an article in Newsweek magazine, Christians are being murdered for their faith from one end of the Muslim world to the other and yet the mainstream media remains quiet. Like it was in ancient Rome, there is a war on to destroy the faith of believers in Christ, and this war is coming to our own shores. We must ask ourselves what it would take for us to deny our faith.

Preparing for the Day of Calamity, Part 3
It's easy to get anxious about the declining state of culture, and the sense that economic collapse is around the corner. How should believers approach living in a world that is on the edge of calamity? James' words two thousand years ago are as relevant now as they were then. The bottom line: "Be patient, for the Lord is coming."

Many people stash away cash in case the day of calamity comes. But what if your money's of no value on that day? To trust in riches is to trust in a vapor that passes away. James talks a great deal about economic justice for the poor, telling us that one day, our gold and silver will not buy anything. Today we'll learn some stark lessons for a future that may be just around the corner.

Many people watch the stock market like a hawk. Some get nervous when the price of gold drops. Money is something we all need, but one day the money we crave will be no more. One day, all transient things that give us security will vanish, and that is the day of final judgment. Then, what we are on the inside will be all that matters

The Desert, The Devil, and You, Part 4
The Word of God is sharper than any two-edged sword. It's powerful, and when we quote it, the devil is sent running. No temptation comes to us that we cannot handle. The devil's attempts to pull us off the track will fail if we are diligent to meditate in and memorize God's Word. Today we will look at some final lessons we can apply from understanding how the Son of God dealt with our common enemy.

The Desert, The Devil, and You, Part 3 of 4
Sometimes we're tempted to take the easy way out of a trial, even though we know that the easy way is not God's way. A hungry and thirsty Jesus was offered all the kingdoms of the world if only He would worship Satan. We too sometimes see a quick solution to our crisis, and are tempted to dishonor God to meet legitimate needs.

The Desert, The Devil, and You, Part 2 of 4
At a point of great physical weakness in the desert, Jesus encountered Satan, who tempted Him to fall down in worship. Satan tempts all of God's children, to get them to veer off the path God has set before them. The devil tries to trap us into thinking that sin is appealing and that its consequences are manageable.

Sometimes we find ourselves going directly from times of great blessing to times of great trial. That's what happened to Jesus. He was led by God into the wilderness and found Himself tempted to sin by the devil. Hungry and thirsty, He was very vulnerable, but fought off Satan using solely the Word of God

Wherever you look, mass media is always saying that having more is what life is all about--more money, a bigger house, and more luxurious vacations. Paradoxically, having less can actually be a greater blessing. Having less means depending on and reaching out to those around you because you have to. Family and community mean much more when tough times come. As you face your tough times, take some lessons from the life of a woman in the Old Testament.

The story of Ruth and Naomi is heart wrenching. Faced with calamity, Ruth begs Naomi to let her stay with her. The hard times of life can either make us bitter or they can lead us to reach out to others. Naomi and daughter-in-law Ruth traveled to Bethlehem, where a man named Boaz cared for Ruth and ultimately married her. Today we will learn more lessons from a woman of great faith.

It's been said that if all the tears people ever cried could be gathered up, they would fill an ocean. Sorrow comes to all of us. Life has joys, but some think that joy is all life should have. But it's through tears that we learn to depend on God for every breath, every bite of food, and every dollar in our wallets. Today we will focus on a story of famine and crisis, and how God met a woman's needs.

Trusting God When The Wells Are Dry, Part 4 of 4
When tough times come, we're all in the same boat, but not everyone reacts in the same way. How we react is crucial. Maintaining our trust in God's provision is vital when we undergo the tests of famine and deprivation. Some fail the test, and try to avoid God's intended pathway. God can be trusted, even when things look bleak. Today, Pastor Lutzer will remind us what to do in times of crisis.

When tough times come, God shakes us up to make sure we remember who our real provider is. He can sustain us through adversity when we accept the limitations that adversity brings. Downsizing may not be fun, but it may be necessary when the money dries up. But through this, God works to develop our characters. Today we will study some key principles to hang onto when your crisis comes.

Is it ever right to lie to avoid a greater evil? That's a choice one man faced who feared his wife would be taken from him. Abram would later become Abraham, but before God changed his name, Abram tried to escape famine by taking his family to Egypt. Genesis 12 tells the story of attempted deceit and its aftermath. For a time, the lie actually worked.

When God wants to deepen our spiritual maturity, He sometimes takes away all the comforts we're used to. We may have to move when our jobs fall apart. Some of us are told that we have only months to live. However, God can lead His people into the wilderness for their greater good and for His greater glory. After all, that's what happened to Abraham.

A storm is coming, the storm of God's judgment on America. We may be at the tipping point where judgment is inevitable. So how should we prepare for the tough times that loom on the horizon?

The days ahead may well be days of less money, fewer options, higher prices, and more uncertainty. For many, the comforts we have known may fade away into a tougher reality -- no job, no insurance, perhaps a foreclosed home. How do we handle deprivation when all we have known is abundance? Today, we begin a series to prepare us for "such a time as this."

Your church needs you out on life's racetrack, running alongside the other members to get the job done together. The challenge for the new year is "get involved." That's what Esther did at a crucial point in the history of the Jewish people. She got involved even at great personal risk, as we should in order to face the daunting challenges of 2013.

Most of our choices do not affect world history. But sometimes, God puts us in situations where they can, and do. To save her people from extinction, Esther faced the risk of execution to beg the king of Persia to rescind a royal edict. She did not try to "pass the buck." She knew that at that key moment, "the buck stopped here."

Temptations to sin do not stop the moment a person becomes a Christian. In fact, they may become even greater. The enemy of our souls will do anything to keep us mired in the sins we used to commit.

As wonderful as God's grace is, and the forgiveness He grants to those who believe in Jesus, it is easily misunderstood. Some may think that once they have believed, they can live as they like -- enjoy the pleasures of sin now plus have the assurance of heaven later. This may be the ultimate form of delusional self-obsession. Today, we will discuss why these people may not be Christians at all.

It is natural to be selfish. It is natural to put yourself first, and to make yourself look good. All of this is natural, just as it is also natural to sin, to disobey God in ways both big and small. Until we are redeemed by faith in Jesus, we will never be free of our obligation to sin. But once that transaction takes place, we are set free from our old master to serve Christ.

At first glance, the deal seems almost too good to be true. God forgives us, and then we can live as we like. At least that's one take on the abundant grace of God, but it's not the take a true believer would have. Romans 6 tells us why a person given the gift of righteousness by God would never sin just to see more grace abound in his life.

In the garden of Eden, an infection entered the human race. That infection has since spread to every last one of us. The infection is sin, which means "missing the mark" of God's standards.

If life became unliveable and you felt suicidal, the one thing that might keep you alive is the thought that someone loves you. To be hopeless is to see nothing but darkness at the end of the tunnel.

Two obvious opposites are war and peace. When someone is at war with himself or others, he can have no personal peace. And when one is still under sin's penalty, they're at war with God. Thankfully, Romans 5 says that those justified by faith have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. This peace is just the first of many gifts all wrapped up in being justified by faith.

Recently, almost 37,000 Americans saw no way out of their misery and committed suicide. These people had one thing in common: they'd lost all hope that things could get better.

Rescued from Misplaced Faith, Part 3 of 3
How important is our faith? It's a very big deal to God, as we read in Genesis 15:6, "Abraham believed the Lord, and He credited it to him as righteousness." This concept, amplified by Paul in the book of Romans, tells us how to be declared righteous by a holy God. What is more, Abraham's faith kept him going up the hill to Mount Moriah with his son Isaac.

Rescued from Misplaced Faith, Part 2 of 3
Many people have gone through religious rituals that they believe made them Christians. Are these people misguided? When Paul wrote to the Romans, he gave conclusive evidence that no ritual can confer salvation. He let his Jewish readers know that their father Abraham was not justified through circumcision. Today, more on why believing in rituals is to have misplaced faith.

Rescued from Misplaced Faith, Part 1 of 3
Think of this, the value of placing your faith in something is all about the object of your faith, and not about the faith itself. You can believe that an idol is God, but that does not change the fact that the idol is made of stone. Faith in the wrong place is worse than no faith at all because it creates false confidence. And when it comes to salvation, the last thing we need is false confidence.

Rescued from Despair, Part 4 of 4
As a youth, Martin Luther was terrified of a holy God. He entered a German monastery to try to gain God's approval, but only after reading the book of Romans did he understand this: God's favor and forgiveness are freely granted to those who believe in His Son. Faith, not good works, is the key that opens heaven's door. Today we will hear the lessons we can learn from one man's journey to faith.

Rescued from Despair, Part 3 of 4
Like barnacles on a boat, traditions had attached themselves to the Christian faith for well over a thousand years. It took a man like Martin Luther to free the church from darkness. Luther found salvation by reading the book of Romans, and used his newfound faith to change the church's course toward a biblical understanding of salvation. He rediscovered the meaning of grace, justification, and faith.

When Martin Luther comprehended the meaning behind "justification by faith" in the book of Romans, he unleashed a religious firestorm, his actions led to a great Reformation -- a breaking away from the Roman Catholic Church -- that altered the landscape of Europe. Long-held tradition gave way to a resurgence of faith in the Word of God, a faith possessed by every believer, not just the priesthood.

The book of Romans has played a major role in world history. By reading its pages a man came to faith in Christ -- a man whose actions began a tidal wave of spiritual power across Europe and the entire world. His name was Martin Luther, and today we will begin tracing his story -- the story of a man desperate to know how he could be right before a holy God.

Fact: all of us are sinners. Fact: all of us are under condemnation. Fact: no one can save themselves. Fact: God did something about this. Fact: God's justice was satisfied in the death of His only Son. Fact: God's mercy flows freely to all who believe in Jesus. Fact: those who believe in Jesus are as righteous as Jesus. Fact: you can believe and be saved.

Rescued from God's Righteous Wrath, Part 2 of 3
If you want to stretch your mind as well as your heart, set aside the time it takes to read the book of Romans. Paul's reasoning is complex, but clear. He proves that all of us are under a just condemnation for sin, but that all who believe in Jesus are rescued from that condemnation and given a robe of righteousness by God Himself. This is the best news anyone has ever heard.

The Apostle Paul was trained in the Law. His writings reveal a mind keen enough to argue before the Supreme Court. In Romans 3, he builds a case for the revolutionary idea that God demands perfect righteousness from us. God then supplies what He demands by conferring the righteousness of Jesus on those who believe. This process is called justification.

Rescued from the Folly of Self-Salvation, Part 3 of 3
No matter how much we try to improve ourselves through education and cultural sensitivity, it's never going to be enough, the best we can do will never please God, who sees every act of human goodness as a filthy rag, especially when compared to His own righteousness. That's why through the gospel He confers His own righteousness on those who believe in His Son. Now that's truly "amazing grace."

Humans are a mixed bag -- some of our impulses are truly generous, but others are based purely on self-interest. The Apostle Paul shows us the truth about the human heart in Romans 3 and it's not a pretty picture. Quoting from the Psalms, Paul leaves us tried, convicted, sentenced, and in desperate need of a hand from heaven to raise us from our inherent sinfulness.

It's clear the Apostle Paul knew nothing of "political correctness," because some of what he wrote was quite unpopular. He catalogs the depth of human depravity in Romans 3, a list many would argue with, but an accurate list nonetheless. As we read it, we see our true condition and why we're in such desperate need of the grace of God as revealed in Jesus.

Some people will tell a falsehood, saying to themselves, "it's only a little white lie." To God, it's a sin, and sin is never a good idea, no matter what good we think may come from it. As we continue to journey through Romans 3, we lose the hypocrisy, take off the mask, and become real people -- really clean from the inside out.

In defending the gospel to his Jewish readers, Paul wrote of their lack of faith, as compared to God's faithfulness. In Romans, he affirmed that faithfulness in the strongest terms. Some see the promises of God to Israel as having been transferred to the church since Israel was unfaithful. Today: a resounding declaration that God is by no means finished with Israel as a nation.

Football players call it "putting on their game face" -- projecting an air of invincibility whether or not they feel that way. To some degree, everyone projects an outward appearance that may not square with inner reality. With regard to salvation, it's easy to make yourself and others believe that all is well when it's not.

When carpenters renovate a house, it's common to do some demolition before they can begin the new construction. In the process, they can uncover hidden water damage that has festered for years. Cleaning out the rot must be done first, then the new work can start. In Romans 2, Paul details the hidden rot of sin that infects everyone, and the self-deceptions people use to keep up their outward appearances.

When we adopt an aura of religious respectability, it's amazing what dark secrets lie beneath the surface where no one can see. Many of us do exactly what we accuse others of doing. We deceive ourselves and say God makes an exception for us, but not for them. Paul excoriated the Jewish religious elite for causing God's name to be blasphemed.

Investors like getting a tip from someone on the inside track -- someone who can give them an edge. It's like the religious elite who thought their status gave them a sure shot at God's favor when it came time for God to judge them. Paul demolishes that kind of self-deception in Romans 2. God does not show favoritism.

Religion can prevent people from understanding the truth about themselves. Religion can breed the pride that says "I'm okay." In Romans 2, Paul addresses the religious elite of his day, and shows them how ceremony had insulated them from God's analysis of their hearts. Self-deception is especially deep when expressed in religious terms.

Those who push the gay lifestyle are successful in making their voices heard loudly in the public media. If you believe sex belongs between a husband and wife, you're deemed "out of step."

Today we'll discuss the massive moral deception that is gripping society -- and what God expects from those who call themselves Christians.

You can have your own opinion, but you can't have your own truth. Truth is absolute and applies to everybody.

When a man rejects God as Creator, he believes that random molecules just happened to turn themselves into life. He frees himself from accountability to God by declaring that he's nothing but chemicals that, by chance, became a human being. Atheistic Darwinism gives cover for those who want no part of a God who demands moral behavior. This is the condition of man we see in Romans 1.

Reading the book of Romans is like shining a light into a dark closet. In its pages we see ourselves as we really are. We find that apart from God's grace, we are capable of awful things. In fact, we are morally bankrupt compared to the God who created us. Today we'll probe the darkness of the human heart, and witness the amazing light God sheds into those hearts that come to believe in Jesus.

When a man is clinging to a life preserver, his sense of self-sufficiency is severely challenged. He knows he needs help. But in today's culture, many people get offended if you tell them there is nothing they can do to make themselves look good before a holy God. The gospel tells us how God set out to rescue from spiritual death those that believe in His Son.

The word "gospel" simply means "good news." When a sinner understands his or her condition, that's good news because it means they realize they need help. God set a rescue plan in motion long before any of us were born -- a plan to redeem mankind was built into creation itself. The monumental scale of what the gospel is all about is revealed in the book of Romans.

Sinners can't save themselves, so God has given us a rescue plan from heaven.

To many people, the Bible is nothing more than something you put your hand on to be sworn into office. Beyond that, it's just Jewish myths and moral teaching. However, the sixty-six books that make up our Bible contain powerful, life-changing truths, thanks to the God who made sure we're reading what He intended us to read.

7 Reasons Why You Can Trust the Bible
Sometimes in a business deal, the negotiations come down to one choice -- you either take it or leave it. As a guidebook for the race of life, we must either take the Bible as it is, or reject it outright. Picking only the parts you like will not do.

The Motivation of Love, Part 4 of 4
As the songwriter penned, "Love is a Many-Splendored Thing." And its greatest splendors are found in 1 Corinthians 13. Real love seeks the good of others first, and our personal benefit last. This is a far cry from the way people are attracted to each other these days. But as Christians, we are held to a higher standard. We are called to love others as Christ has.

The Motivation of Love, Part 3 of 4
From time to time the issue of spiritual gifts has divided believers. Speaking in tongues has long caused contention. The Apostle Paul put that issue to rest a long time ago in his writings to the church at Corinth. He taught that there is something that far transcends all spiritual gifts -- and that something is love.

The Motivation of Love, Part 2 of 4
These days, the problem with the word "love" is one of definition. People "love" their cars, and "love" new fashions. But millennia ago, the Apostle Paul wrote the ultimate essay on love. After studying 1 Corinthians 13, there's no doubt as to what real love is, and what it isn't. Today we will study more details on God's view of love -- the love He shows us, and the love we are to show to others.

The Motivation of Love, Part 1 of 4
The world has little interest in the doctrines of Christianity. But it takes notice when believers love one another. As someone has said, our lives are the books that people read every day. Those outside the church are drawn to experience the love that believers share. Today we'll take a look at why we do what we do, and what our underlying motive must be if we are to reach the lost.

Finding Your Priorities, Part 3 of 3
In the body of Christ, the strong help the weak, and the healthy help the ailing. No one has to face life's tough times alone. As each member of the body first submits to God and then serves others, the whole body thrives. In today's message, Pastor Lutzer provides some tips on how to support each other in times of need.

Finding Your Priorities, Part 2 of 3
Christians are commanded to present their bodies as living sacrifices acceptable to God. This isn't easy. The pressure is on -- from within and without -- for us to do anything but be living sacrifices. In other words, we want to get off the altar and "do our own thing." Today: some practical help on how to get back on the altar and stay there.

Each of us makes choices every day -- how to use our time, talents, and treasure, and on setting priorities. As members of the body of Christ we have a mission to fulfill, so a disciplined use of our resources is key to getting God's work done. Today we will look at how to determine our priorities and how to live by them.

Finding Your Place, Part 3 of 3
The word "diversity" scares some people. They'd rather spend time with like-minded people than embrace those they consider different. But in the body of Christ, there is great diversity. And each believer has a unique contribution to make to the growth of Christ's kingdom on Earth.

Finding Your Place, Part 2 of 3
For some reason, we tend to think that God is somewhere "up there" looking down to see how His children are doing. But the New Testament paints a different picture in which God sees believers as part of Christ's body -- the church -- in a union with Him as intimate as the connection between the parts of a human body. As Christians running the race of life, we don't run alone. We share the actual life of God Himself.

There's something inside each of us that makes us want to belong and be connected with others in something bigger than ourselves. As Christians, we are blessed to be part of an invisible assembly -- the worldwide body of Christ that transcends denominational barriers. Let's explore why it's so vital that we understand the body of Christ and our part in it.

Unwrapping Your Gift, Part 4 of 4
No self-respecting kid would leave a Christmas present unwrapped. And in the same way, no believer should leave their spiritual gift unwrapped. Each Christian has been entrusted with a unique spiritual capability. Without its use, the body of Christ is incomplete. Today we'll learn some details on the three different kinds of gifts the Spirit gives to believers.

The employees of a well-run company know their abilities as well as the roles they play in making that company profitable. They know that "doing your own thing" is the last way to succeed in any group endeavor. In the body of Christ, believers need each other in the common task of ministry, all serving by using their unique spiritual gifts.

When you take apart an old alarm clock you'll see an amazing array of gears working together to make sure you wake up on time. If any gear gets out of place, the whole thing grinds to a halt. It's similar in the local church. If people aren't serving where God wants them to serve, the whole ministry is shortchanged. Today's message will help us learn what spiritual gifts are and why it's vital that we find which gifts we have.

Ever feel like a square peg in a round hole? Try as you might, you never seem to fit in. Happily, there's a solution. God has a place of service for every Christian, and a spiritual gift every Christian can use to benefit others. And if we fail to use our gifts, the body of Christ suffers. Today, we'll explore how to identify our gifts, and how to put them to work.

Ever wonder what heaven will be like? The best description we have is that of the Holy City -- the New Jerusalem. In this glorious, gigantic city, the saints will enjoy equality. We'll be in perfect health, serving God together, all in the blaze of "no more night," and all of this into "the ages of the ages." Today we will take a final look at the believer's eternal home, and a look at who gets to live there.

Imagine an endless eternity in the presence of God Almighty. No sin, just the light of holiness. The Jewish temple had a Holy of Holies where God dwelt. In eternity, the Holy City is that Holy of Holies. No priest will be needed to mediate our access because Jesus is our High Priest. Today: more on the wonders of Revelation 21 and the believer's eternal home.

After the Millenial reign of Jesus, heaven literally comes down to Earth in the form of the New Jerusalem. This spectacular city will be the eternal home of the redeemed of all the ages. This is what Jesus referred to when He said "in My Father's house are many dwelling places." The Holy City is beyond imagination, but in today's message we'll make an attempt to grasp its wonder.

The King Judges Unbelievers, Part 3 of 3
The judgment for all who never believed in Jesus is both awful and eternal. We can't even conceive of what Hell would be like. So how do we avoid this irreversible sentence? The answer is found in the most famous verse in the Bible: John 3:16. We appeal to all who listen to take advantage of God's plan of salvation.

It's not easy to grapple with the reality of an eternal hell. The idea of hell is repugnant. But the Bible teaches that there is an ultimate lake of fire. When all is said and done, we either believe what the Bible says, or we reject it to our own peril. Let's learn about the basis of judgment for those who never heard the gospel, and for those who did.

Revelation 20:15 states, "And if anyone's name was not found in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire." The idea of a final judgment offends many people. They can't conceive of a God who would send anyone to a fiery hell. In today's message, we'll take a sobering look at what the Bible teaches about the final destiny of those who didn't believe in Jesus for salvation.

After a thousand years of peace on Earth, you'd think everyone would be happy. Unfortunately, that isn't the case. As the Millenium wraps up, there's a final rebellion, and a final battle to quell it. It's then that Satan finally gets what he deserves -- an infinite sentence in a lake of fire. Today we'll learn how things will end as history terminates and eternity begins.

One reason for world peace during the coming Millennial kingdom? Our arch-enemy, Satan, will be locked up the whole time. Revelation 20 details the devil's incarceration. With Satan's mischief under wraps, the redeemed that enter this wondrous time find that even nature has changed -- the lion will dwell with the lamb. Today we'll study a literal thousand-year reign of Jesus.

"Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more." That is the Millennium -- a thousand years of enforced peace on Earth under the rule of Jesus Christ. Long prophesied, this utopia will be centered in Jerusalem. What the U.N. could never do, Jesus will do. Today, we'll learn what the Millennium is and why it's coming.

When Jesus Christ returns in glory, Revelation 19 says He'll do so riding on a white horse. With Him will be the armies of heaven, set to destroy all who oppose Him. He'll reign with a rod of iron, treading the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty God. No negotiations. No peace talks. Just total destruction, and the onset of His kingdom on Earth.

When history culminates in the return of Jesus, democracy will have run its course. He'll appear in glory, radiating absolute authority. And as He descends from heaven, He'll slay His enemies with a sharp sword, then set up a world government headquartered in Jerusalem. These future events, outlined in the Bible, will certainly come to pass.

In the movies, we've seen a lot of planets explode among other special effects. But we've never seen what's actually to come. The return of Jesus in glory will rivet the attention of every eye on Earth. Nothing else will matter. History will culminate in one spectacular appearance that will end millennia of wrongs, and usher in a thousand years of peace once all of Christ's enemies have been vanquished.

The great battle foretold in Ezekiel 38 and 39 will be epic both in its scale and its outcome. A huge army marches to destroy Israel.

In the future, many nations will join together to try and destroy Israel. The Bible says they'll be led by a nation from the north. Ezekiel prophesies this attempt, and foretells that it'll be neutralized by God who arises to defend His people. This great battle will prepare Israel for the climactic events leading to the return of Jesus to Earth.

In numerous prophecies, God promises to defend Israel when it's under attack. Take Ezekiel 38 where we read of a coalition of nations marching to destroy Israel.

According to Jesus, the last half of the great tribulation will bring judgment never before seen on planet Earth -- a combination of judgments so severe that, unless their duration was shortened, no one would be left alive.

God is long-suffering -- He withholds His righteous judgment for a long time. But not forever. During the Great Tribulation, God's judgment falls on the people of Earth. Despite the wrath they'll face, the majority of mankind will refuse to repent. Jesus spoke in some detail about this time in Matthew 24. Let's learn what's ahead for a world that has rejected Jesus.

In Matthew 24, Jesus spells out what will happen as history draws to a close: the great tribulation, a time of judgment, will precede His glorious return to earth.

As history careens toward its conclusion, there's a time coming known as the Great Tribulation. The whole world will see suffering like never before.

The future Antichrist is called the "beast" in Revelation 13 -- an apt name for a man claiming to be God. He'll have fearsome power and influence. But that power will wither into nothingness when he's confronted by Jesus when He returns to Earth. In today's messages, we'll learn some lessons about the coming Antichrist.

In amazing detail, the Bible foretells the worldwide political scene into which Jesus will return. The world will be led by a ruler known as the anti-Christ who is under Satan's total control. This man represents the antithesis to Christ. And just like matter and anti-matter cannot co-exist, the anti-Christ will find himself vanquished by the Son of God.

The Old Testament book of Daniel has amazing parallels to the New Testament book of Revelation. Daniel gives us a lot of information about the coming Antichrist -- a man who will deceive the world into believing he's God. Today, we learn something about the timeline of his short career as world ruler -- short because Jesus will terminate it when He returns.
