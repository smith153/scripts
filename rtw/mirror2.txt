The King Tolerates His Rival, Part 1 of 3
Scientists theorize the existence of anti-matter which releases unimaginable energy when it comes in contact with matter. The Bible tells about a future anti-Christ, but this isn't a theory. He'll be a great world leader who seeks and gets the worship of mankind. This evil being will be a rival to the real Christ, and his career will mimic that of Jesus, as he dies and is raised again.

The King Marries His Bride, Part 3 of 3
Many believers feel that drinking wine is wrong. Each Christian must have a clear conscience on whether or not to partake. But a day is coming when each Christian will partake. They'll drink the finest wine that has ever been made, and they will drink it with Jesus Himself -- the same Jesus who made wine for a wedding feast in Cana. The occasion? The Marriage Supper of the Lamb.

The King Marries His Bride, Part 2 of 3
The marriage supper of the Lamb will be a dinner like no other. Sitting at that dinner table will be the redeemed of all ages: Old Testament prophets, New Testament apostles, and believers from the dawn of time. This feast will mark the culmination of the redemptive work of Christ. He welcomes all Christians to eat with Him in heaven. Today we'll continue our look at the ultimate wedding.

In Greek, the word we translate "church" means "the called-out ones" -- a special group with a special destiny. In Revelation 19:9, a voice from the throne of God says "Write: 'Blessed are those who are called to the Marriage Supper of the Lamb!' And he said to me, 'These are the true sayings of God.'" This special group of the "called-out ones" have an engraved invitation to the greatest wedding feast of all time.

The King Judges Us, Part 4 of 4
There's a misconception that a Christian never has to face judgment since Jesus paid it all. But the New Testament teaches that though believers are shielded from the wrath of God, they will answer for the deeds done in the body. What is at stake is not judgment, but the degree of reward.

The King Judges Us, Part 3 of 4
Many believers go about their daily routines unaware that their every deed, good or bad, will be reviewed -- every argument, every unkind word, every impure motive. We will stand before Jesus to answer for how we lived our lives. This is the place where rewards are bestowed, and also, where the chaff of our lives is burned into powder. Today we will discuss more on the judgment of believers.

High school and college students study all semester because they know a final exam awaits them at the end of the course. Most employees get reviewed every year to see if a pay raise is warranted. In all of life, a day of accountability is built into whatever we do. The same is true for a believer's appoinment at the Judgment Seat of Christ. Today: what that certain appointment will be like.

The Bema seat was an elevated platform in ancient Corinth where the judges sat. Bema is the word that Paul uses when referring to the Judgment Seat of Christ. In Corinth, the Bema was outside and public -- and so may be a Christian's account at the Judgment Seat of Christ.

The bodies of untold millions of believers in Jesus lie in graveyards all over Earth. One day, those graves will open and the dead in Christ will rise when Jesus returns. Those who are alive at the time of His coming will join them moments later. We'll discuss more about a future day when our bodies will be made immortal.

The King Returns for Us, Part 2 of 3
The hearts of the disciples were heavy on the night their Master told them of His impending death and resurrection. He told them that when He returned, He would receive them unto Himself, that where He was, they would be also. As the young church was forming, many were wondering when He would return. They didn't know that over two millennia would pass.

Somewhere there is a Doomsday clock that measures how close we are to annihilating ourselves. But what most people don't realize is that another clock is ticking, and one day, Jesus will return to Earth. Man's failed history will be wrapped up when the King of Kings takes charge. Today we lift our eyes to the horizon.

Getting Eternity Right, Part 4 of 4
Eons of time, the phrase, in the Greek language, means "into the ages of the ages." We invest heavily in the few years we have on Earth. But most of us invest very little in the life that follows. Jesus made it clear that we need to reset our priorities and live with the view of eternal life in front of us.

Getting Eternity Right, Part 3 of 4
The parables of Jesus cut to the deepest level of human motivation. In the story of the rich fool, greed was one issue, but covetousness was another. None of us is free from the grip of wanting more. If this sin blocks our view of what's really important, our very eternity is at stake. What we can take home from a parable is as meaningful today as it was when spoken two millennia ago.

Most Americans have more stuff stashed in their garages and closets than they will ever use. Jesus told of a man who had too much stuff and needed bigger barns to hold it all. The man's error was assuming his stuff was all he needed. The man didn't realize that his deepest need was for something his barns could never hold.

There is no U-Haul following your hearse to the cemetery. As the saying goes, "you can't take it with you." Jesus told a story about a man who had a lot, but wanted a lot more. It was this man who said "eat, drink and be merry." The parable is chilling, because that night his life was demanded of him. If there's one thing you want to get right, it's where you will spend eternity.

Getting Investments Right, Part 3 of 3
In a shaky market, people wonder where they can place money to get a decent return. These days, options are few. Jesus taught a lesson on ultimate investments in a parable recorded in Luke's gospel. He counsels believers to invest in God's kingdom, because only in eternity will the true interest rate be on display.

Getting Investments Right, Part 2 of 3
Common investment advice is to buy low and sell high. In other words, get as much financial return as possible. In good times, stocks and bonds run hot. In shaky times, silver and gold look safer. Jesus taught that the best possible return can only be gotten by investing our money for eternal dividends. Today we'll discuss the rationale behind the statement, "you can take it with you."

A wealthy man had a manager he decided to fire. Before he left, the manager cut some deals with his master's creditors. The deals were meant to curry favor so that the manager would have options once his job ended. Jesus made this scenario the subject of a parable about investments, and today, we'll decipher why Christ commended a man who acted improperly.

Getting Evangelism Right, Part 3 of 3
Jesus told a story of a great banquet where invited guests all had excuses for not attending. So the host changed his plans. He invited the poor, the crippled -- those who would never expect such a treat, and who could never repay him. This parable has parallels in how we approach telling people about the gospel, so let's explore how best to understand it.

Getting Evangelism Right, Part 2 of 3
When you get a letter from Queen Elizabeth inviting you to a royal event, it's expected that you'll show up. Jesus told of a banquet where a lot of people didn't show up. Their excuses didn't amuse the host, and so he scoured the countryside for people to dine at his table. This parable is a picture of the offer of the gospel to a lost mankind.

Getting Evangelism Right, Part 1 of 3
Some Christians view evangelism as a chore, with no clue as to how much God's heart is gladdened when they do it. Jesus told a parable about a man hosting a banquet. When the invited guests begged off, he found anyone he could to sit at his table. God seeks the lost just like this man sought people to feed. Today we'll look at an inspiring lesson on reaching people with the gospel.

In a parable, Jesus told of the responses made by three servants when their master gave them money to invest. Two made substantial returns on the money and were rewarded. The third wrapped his in a piece of cloth and felt the wrath of his master. Today we'll study an interpretation of this parable that likens the money to the gospel, and how we spread that gospel to others.

Some of us view courtroom scenes as entertainment. With so many of them on television these days, it's hard not to. But if you're in the dock, it's suddenly very real, especially when there's a lot at stake. One day, every believer will be on trial for their faithfulness to Christ. What we did with what we were given will be evaluated. Are you ready for your date in the courtroom of Jesus?

Every employee is evaluated by his or her boss. Every CEO is being evaluated by his or her stockholders. How we handle today's small task affects whether or not we're given a larger task to perform and the rewards that go with it. Jesus taught a parable about faithfulness, and what the perils are for our lack of faithfulness. Today we'll discuss more spiritual lessons from the words of Jesus.

In the Civil War, the South wore gray and the North wore blue. No one was neutral about whose side they were on. In spiritual warfare, you are either in the kingdom of light or the kingdom of darkness. Jesus said "whoever does not gather with Me scatters." Today, another look at parables that help us fight the good fight during a time when Satan can still cause a lot of trouble.

Individualism is a mark of the American spirit. We like to "go it alone." This doesn't work in spiritual warfare. Jesus taught through the use of parables or stories. He told of a strong man, and man who was even stronger, whose help is crucial in defeating the merely "strong" man. Today we'll study more lessons on why we can't go it alone. We can only defeat Satan in the name and power of Jesus.

Talk about missing the point! Jesus casts out a demon, and His critics argue about how He cast it out. Nevermind that a man was freed from a lifetime of oppression. Then Jesus used the parable of a strong man to explain how we should fight battles in the spiritual realm. Let's discuss the story, and the lessons we can learn.

In the modern era, few seriously believe the idea of evil spirits inhabiting people. They call it mental illness. But demons are very real. Jesus drove demons out of many people, freeing them from self-destruction. There is an unseen spiritual realm -- a realm of conflict between the powers of darkness and the powers of light. Today we'll learn lessons from the Master Teacher on how to fight this battle.

Getting Rewards Right, Part 3 of 3
It's tough to let go of our inborn desire for fairness. "Why can't I have what the other guy has?" In God's Kingdom, it's different. He choose to give some of His children more than others -- more abilities, more money, and better health. When we realize that it's the Giver who makes the call, we've come a long way toward understanding how God rewards His people.

Jesus told of a landowner who hired men to work in his vineyard. In this parable fairness is the issue. The pay was the same whether a man worked all day or just for the last hour. The bottom line is that the landowner can pay whatever he wants to pay, since each man got what was promised. Listen as Dr. Lutzer explains how this parable should be interpreted.

If life were fair, everybody would have the same salary. Everybody would have the same kind of house. But life is not fair. Through a parable, Jesus taught His disciples about the rewards which are handed out in the Kindgom of God. At first glance, what He taught seems quite unfair. Let's look beneath the surface of the words of Jesus and see the life-changing truth that upends our innate sense of fairness.

The story of the prodigal son is really the story of two prodigals. One left in rebellion, the other stayed in rebellion. The elder brother was angry that his father had mercy on his younger brother. Today we'll take another look into Jesus' parable which illustrates how the Father in heaven relates to His children, even when those children go astray.

Getting Parenting Right, Part 2 of 3
Perhaps no parable of Jesus has drawn as many tears as that of the prodigal son. That's because we are all prodigals. When the father greets and forgives his returning son, we see how much God desires to forgive His children and receive them back into fellowship. We understand our own tendency to wander, and we can rejoice that God wants us to return home.

When the Bible tells a story, it always rings true to human experience. This is very clear in the story of the prodigal son. How should a parent react when a child goes his or her own way, knowing that the end game for that child will be sorrow? In yet another remarkable parable, we can learn some major spiritual truth about the Father and His treatment of us. This truth gives us a picture of the kind of parents we should be.

One parable of Jesus has a dire warning for those who refuse to forgive others from the heart. These are some of Jesus' hardest words to process. Today we will take a careful look at what the Bible means when it says that God will not forgive us if we fail to forgive others. Take a moment to work through this crucial teaching with us.

Being forgiven is not like receiving a get-out-of-jail-free card in Monopoly. Being forgiven puts you under obligation. In Matthew 18, Jesus taught that you must forgive others just as you have been forgiven. Today we will hear about the heart attitude we should have once we experience the forgiveness of God.

When someone wrongs you, you may react with resentment. That resentment can lead to a wellspring of bitterness in your soul, and that bitterness can ruin your life.

Fathers invariably respond to the requests of their kids. In a parable, Jesus says it is the same with God the Father. God is eager to answer the cries of His children. "Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find," He said. Today we will study the subject of prayer, which, for many, is a subject of mystery.

To teach His disciples how God responds to our prayers, Jesus told a parable about a man who needed bread. The man went to a friend at midnight to get food and because of his boldness, he was given some. Jesus teach us to be bold when praying to the Father. He said, "Ask, and it will be given to you." We will probe the mystery of prayer in the simple words spoken by Jesus.

Getting Conversion Right, Part 4 of 4
Jesus taught that it takes several things to bring a person to faith in Christ. It takes seed -- the Word of God. It takes a sower -- a faithful believer communicating his or her faith. And it takes receptive soil -- something only God can provide. In today's message, Dr. Lutzer will summarize the great lessons Jesus gave us in this well-known parable.

Not every word of witnessing results in someone's immediate conversion. The parable of the sower teaches us about different kinds of soil. When the seed of the Gospel is sown, it can land in receptive soil, or soil that won't allow the seed to germinate. Today we'll study more lessons on the good soil -- soil where it's accepted and grows.

In a well-known parable, Jesus compared the spreading of the Gospel to the way a sower spreads seed on the ground. Believers realize that it's not their skill that brings people to Jesus. The grows if, and only if, God gives the increase -- just as Paul wrote to the Corinthian church. Let's take a closer look at the sower and the soils into which the seed is sown.

Not everybody in the crowd understood Jesus when He taught. He used stories to teach -- stories we call parables. The parables used real-life situations to depict spiritual truth. The crowds heard illustrations of farmers, servants, prodigal sons, and those who tended to vineyards. Today we begin a series on ten of these parables, beginning with the sower and his seed.

We need to understand that God judges the nations when they violate His commands. He judged His own nation, Israel, by using the armies of nearby pagan nations against it. Today Dr. Lutzer will share more details about God's purposes among the nations, and why we should not assume that if "you're okay, I'm okay."

The Bible reveals God as more than just interested in the human condition. He is the One who actively determines the fate of the nations. Today we will take a look at how God superintends history.

The Origin of the Nations, Part 3 of 3
Years ago, Alex Haley's Roots helped us understand the origins of the slave trade. Origins are very important. That is why God recorded the beginnings of human history in the book of Genesis. Here we find out where we came from as members of the nations of the world. Today we will do a wrap-up on how everyone can trace their roots back to the sons of Noah.

The Origin of the Nations, Part 2 of 3
There are literally thousands of languages spoken here on planet earth. Have you ever stopped to ask yourself where they all came from? At the very beginning, God saw to it that people would be divided into many geographical and ethnic groups. To achieve this, He caused the language of His people to divide.

The Origin of the Nations, Part 1 of 3
With hundreds of nations and billions of people, the earth of 2012 is a seething cauldron of unrest, warfare, and change. As things seem to be slipping out of control, we must remember that the God who created the nations is not asleep at the switch. He is moving the nations into position for the climax of this present age. Today we begin a series that outlines some of His purposes.

Jesus, the Triumphant Lord, Part 3 of 3
Although the church celebrates the resurrection of Jesus every year, in one sense it celebrates that great event every week. On the first day of the week His disciples found their crucified Lord very much alive. Every Sunday since, God's people have gathered to mark the raising of Jesus from the dead. He is indeed the Victor over the grave. Since we are His followers, we too shall have victory.

Jesus, the Triumphant Lord, Part 2 of 3
The resurrection of the dead at the end times is a huge concept. Imagine billions of graves springing open. This concept, though hard to imagine, is at the core of the gospel. Just as God raised Jesus, so believers too shall be raised with glorious new bodies fit for eternity. It is the real you that will once again live and move.

Jesus, the Triumphant Lord, Part 1 of 3
Many people have said things about Jesus, adding their biases to the biblical account of His life. But the most attested fact of ancient history is the bodily resurrection of Jesus from a cold tomb. It is that resurrection which gives us the promise of our own resurrection one day. God raised Him in power and He will raise all who believed in His Son while alive on this earth.

Jesus, the Servant King, Part 4 of 4
Who killed Jesus? The question is more complex than it first appears.The Romans carried out the crucifixion. But why? Jewish religious leaders wanted Jesus out of the way, but they had to entice the occupying Romans to do the deed. Because Jesus died for the sins of all mankind, in one sense all of us killed the Son of God. Today we look into a centuries-old question.

Jesus, the Servant King, Part 3 of 4
We have all said "no" when we should have said "yes." We all have missed opportunities. Once gone, those decisive moments cannot be regained. The people of Israel had a chance to embrace Jesus as their promised Messiah. Instead, they clamored for His execution. Jesus wept over Jerusalem because He knew that its destruction was certain. Today we will look at an important opportunity which Judas missed.

Jesus, the Servant King, Part 2 of 4
On the Mount of Olives outside Jerusalem is a church called Dominus Flevit, which means "the tears of God." Near this spot, Jesus wept over a city which was soon to be destroyed. God would use the Romans to level the temple in judgment since the nation of Israel did not acknowledge the day of their visitation by the Son of God. In 70 AD, not one stone of the temple was left upon another.

On Palm Sunday we commemorate the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem just days before His trial and crucifixion. Even today, pilgrims to the Holy Land walk the road Jesus walked, imagining the momentous events which led to the sacrifice that makes salvation possible. Jesus entered Jerusalem as a king unlike any who had ever preceded Him.

Jesus, the Controversial Teacher, Part 3 of 3
Football players who put on their "game face" may not always reflect what they feel on the inside. Life is a lot easier if we reflect on the outside what we are on the inside. This was a central point of the famous Sermon on the Mount where Jesus explained in simple terms the kind of character that pleases God.

Jesus, the Controversial Teacher #2 of 3
The Beatitudes are the heart of the Sermon on the Mount. These eight statements sum up the kind of character God wants us to have. Eight times Jesus pronounces a blessing on those who are poor in spirit, those who mourn, who are gentle, who hunger for righteousness, who are merciful, pure in heart, peacemakers, and who endure persecution. Join us as we focus on these monumental words.

Jesus, the Controversial Teacher, Part 1 of 3
No one has ever spoken words of greater simplicity and power than those Jesus spoke in the Sermon on the Mount. Set against the backdrop of the Sea of Galilee, this sermon packs in more truth about the human heart than any ever preached before or since. As a master teacher, Jesus took aim at the inner man and left a mark that still reverberates two thousand years later.

Jesus, the Unexpected Revolutionary, Part 3 of 3
Many people have a "live and let live" approach to life -- "You do your thing, and I'll do mine." Jesus didn't share this approach. He spoke the truth, regardless of the consequences. When the honor of God was at stake, He was not above tossing the moneychangers out of the temple. He lived his life with passion and focus, and as His followers, so should we.

Jesus, the Unexpected Revolutionary, Part 2 of 3
Jesus had no fear of the authorities. Throwing money changers out of the temple proves that. And many of the things He said often angered the religious leaders in Jerusalem. In today's message, we'll take a vivid look at the Son of God confronting those who should have seen Him as Israel's great hope.

Politicians do it, so do the media elite -- they spin the news to their point of view, making truth a casualty. Getting to the genuine Jesus is crucial, since He is the way, the truth, and the life, and no man comes to the Father except through Him. Join us as we begin a series that looks at Jesus without the spin that distorts our understanding of the Son of God.

God Helps Those Who Help Themselves, Part 4 of 4
Once we realize how great our need is before God, we will quickly understand that we cannot somehow help ourselves get to heaven. Once our eyes are open to the truth, we will find that only God has the power to raise sinners from the dead and give them new life. In today's message, Pastor Lutzer will dispel a final myth about God.

God Helps Those Who Help Themselves, Part 3 of 4
All of the good deeds ever done in the world cannot erase the guilt of sin that even a single member of the human race bears before a holy God. The Bible says that all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags. Only God's righteousness opens heaven's doors. That is why we are deceived if we believe that "God helps those who help themselves." Today we unmask a final lie about God.

God Helps Those Who Help Themselves, Part 2 of 4
In one sense it is true that God helps those who help themselves, however, this saying does not apply to salvation. Only those who are helpless can avail themselves of a salvation only God can give. We cannot add anything to the work that has already been done to secure our eternal future.

"God helps those who help themselves..." This is a phrase a lot of people mistakenly think is in the Bible. Certainly we need to take the initiative in many areas of life. But when it comes to the vital issue of salvation, it is crucial to understand what God really says. The Gospel proclaims that we cannot help ourselves. Only Jesus can save us.

We Must Choose Between God's Will and Our Happiness, Part 4 of 4
Americans value their heritage. It is a heritage that makes possible "the pursuit of happiness" -- a pursuit God approves of. Sadly, many think pursuing happiness means not pursuing the will of God, that these two things are mutually exclusive. Let's explore some questions about this common misconception.

Lasting financial gain is often short-circuited by an investor's desires to fast profits. The same is true in life. Going for immediate pleasures can short-circuit our potential to enjoy the overwhelming pleasures of God -- pleasures that can last a lifetime. In today's message, Pastor Lutzer will give us some good reasons why we should think long-term.

We Must Choose Between God's Will and Our Happiness, Part 2 of 4
Somehow a lot of believers have the impression that pleasure and God's will are mutually incompatible. The good news is that God wants you to experience pleasure. The bad news is that a lot of us do not know what real pleasures are. Those who think that sinking in sin will open pleasure's doors have no clue what satisfaction is. God wants to give true satisfaction to His children.

We have all seen those cartoons where the devil whispers into one ear, and an angel whispers into the other. The implication is that choosing sin means happiness, and saying "no" means a humdrum existence. The devil whispers the lie that when we follow the Lord, we kiss all our fun goodbye. Today we will combat another lie about God that you might already believe.

The Fall Ruined God's Plans, Part 4 of 4
The problem of evil is perhaps the most difficult issue facing theologians. God could prevent evil, yet He doesn't. So since He is in charge, the wars and suffering around us must be a part of His plan for the world. For some, this creates a dilemma they cannot resolve. Are you among those who feel this way?

For centuries we have all wrestled with the problem of evil in the world. If God is in charge, why is there so much suffering? And if He is in control, was the fall of humanity something God intended in the first place? Today we are heading into some really deep waters. Grab that life preserver and get ready to swim.

Most of us are preoccupied with the here and now. But let's take a moment to stop and see God as He really is and ask ourselves, "Did the Fall ruin God's plans?" The answer is "no," because nothing can ruin God's plans. In today's message, we'll explore the implications for you and for me.

Like any intellectual pursuit, theology has its fads, one of which is the idea that God does not know our decisions in advance. Going far beyond the classic debates between Calvinists and Arminians, some theologians now say that God has chosen to limit His omniscience so we can fully express our free wills. In today's message, Pastor Lutzer explains why this is not true.

Some theologians see our lives as a chessboard where our moves are countered by God's moves. These thinkers feel that God gives us complete free will, and then adapts Himself to our choices as we make them. To these theologians, the future for God is an unfinished novel. In today's message, Pastor Lutzer will show us the problems with this line of thinking.

When it comes to natural disasters, what's easier to believe: are they products of blind chance? Or do they come from God? The clear choice is the latter.

Can you trust a God who hurls each lightning bolt to the earth during a thunderstorm's terrible fury? Well, the alternative is trusting a God who does not know where the lightning will hit.

It's a deep mystery. Why does God send torrential rains to flooded areas, yet allow parched ground to remain dry? The mystery deepens as we consider our frailty.

Today we will look at more on God's responsibility for "natural disasters" like the recent Asian tsunami.

Before Jesus ascended into heaven, His last word to His followers was a commission to take the Gospel to the ends of the earth. The urgency of His words underscores the fact that He is the only way to God, and that no other religion can save people from certain judgment. For you and for me, and for all humanity, the stakes are high.

In the Old Testament, sin was judged quickly and harshly. Nowadays it seems that sin goes virtually unpunished. Why?

It is popular to think that we can approach God on our own terms. It is said, "All roads lead to Rome." Although humans believe this, the Bible does not endorse it.

God, Yes, but Why Jesus? Part 2a of 4
It is a force you cannot see, but you can certainly feel. It is everywhere, telling people what is okay for them to believe. That force is political correctness, and when it comes to the Christian faith, it is out in full strength. Today we focus on how we should witness in a day when people tolerate everything but the truth.

God, Yes, but Why Jesus? Part 1c of 3
For two thousand years people have been trying to figure out what to do with Jesus Christ. Like Pilate, many reject Him. But others heed His call to believe in Him as the only One who can save them from the sins that separate them from God. Today: more answers to the crucial question many ask: "God, Yes, but Why Jesus?"

God, Yes, but Why Jesus? Part 1b of 3
Some people think that since "all roads lead to Rome," all religions must lead to God. This is an enormous mistake. If your life was at stake in a hospital, you would want the truth about your condition. Your life is at stake, eternally, and finding the truth about your spiritual condition and its remedy has to be "job one." Today, we will learn more about why Jesus is the only road that leads to God.

Tolerance is a big deal these days, and we are all for tolerance. But there is one thing many people cannot tolerate. You can believe anything you want, but you cannot say you have the truth without offending those around you. When you say that Jesus is the truth, people become unglued. We will now take a look at why Jesus is the only way to God, modern pundits notwithstanding.

"The word of God is sharper than any two-edged sword." That is especially true for the words of Jesus, Who knows us through and through. Today we are hearing His words on our motivations, as recorded in Matthew 6. Our job is letting in the light to scatter the darkness in our lives. Too many of us like that darkness.

Surgery is no fun. But the result can be restored health. Spiritual surgery is the same: not fun, but rewarding. Today we will have another session of motivation analysis, as we hear again the words of Jesus in Matthew 6. We will work on understanding and improving our attitudes for why we do what we do.

Good deeds can be seen. Motivations cannot. Why we do what we do is a key focus of Christ's teaching in Matthew 6. Here we experience some radical surgery as our motives are dissected. Why do we do what we do? For the praise of men? The Great Physician wants to get our service for Him back on track. Today: we go to the clinic to get Christ's diagnosis.

Secret Fasting, Part 3 of 3
For some Christians, fasting is about as popular as watching paint dry. Yet we cannot escape Christ's teaching. He assumed that we would fast, and confined His remarks to the "how and why," and not the "if." Foregoing food is a big paradigm shift. Today you are invited to listen for some final thoughts about the benefits and obligations of fasting.

To stop eating for a time has some known health benefits. But in the Christian life, it also has great spiritual benefits. Fasting is not often talked about in a culture where what we usually want is fast food. Today, let us explore further the "why" and "how" of fasting, as Jesus taught in the gospel of Matthew 6.

Secret Fasting, Part 1 of 3
The holidays are a great time for food. Most of us really enjoy eating, but there are times in a Christian's life when eating should be the last thing on the agenda. Today, we will set aside that big luncheon we had planned on attending and remind ourselves of Christ's teaching on the benefits of fasting.

Secret Praying, Part 4 of 4
Many of us say grace together before eating a big meal. We are reminded of Who we have to thank for all that we have, so prayer is the vehicle that takes our thanks before His throne. Jesus also taught us to pray in secret, that we might be rewarded openly. Prayer is the means of maintaining close, personal contact with God.

We have all heard the Lord's Prayer, either set to music or recited in church. Jesus gave us these words as a pattern. He gave us this prayer to teach us how to pray. Today, we continue our look at the depth and breadth of meaning latent in these sacred words, and on the way we should each approach God with our petitions.

Sometimes Christians wonder if God is listening when they pray. We often repeat our requests, just to make sure He has heard us, but Jesus taught us that God is indeed listening, and in fact, knows what we need before we ask. This being the case, many wonder why we should even pray at all. Therefore, please join us today for more lessons in the school of secret prayer.

Every good athlete knows that success in front of the roaring crowd depends on those workouts done when no one is watching. In the race of life, success with God depends on time spent in secret with Him, time spent in the discipline of prayer. For many, prayer is mysterious, especially private prayer.

Secret Giving, Part 4 of 4
Even for a Christian, the old nature is a powerful enemy. In our sinful flesh we want to take the credit for giving a gift. Meanwhile, God wants us to give our gifts in secret, so only He knows who did what. That way we cannot flaunt our donations as badges of honor. We must learn to give to others so as to please God first and foremost.

"....the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil..." the Bible's words ring true even for Christians. Money can be our idol and we can be its worshippers. God wants to break money's stranglehold on our hearts, and the key is giving in secret. Today we will seek to find the right motives and methods to do just that.

There is one thing Jesus really disapproved of. He told His followers to not give money so as to be seen by others. God wants our giving to be a secret we keep with Him. After all, God, not the IRS, keeps the ultimate books. It is one thing to give when others can see your generosity. Today we will examine our motives for giving when no one is watching.

Good friends can keep secrets. In fact, one test of a relationship is how much you can trust someone to keep a confidence. Our ultimate confidence is in God, with Whom we can safely entrust any secret. In fact, there are four secrets He wants us to share with Him, with life-changing results.

Just Let God Lead, Part 3 of 3
Another year ends tomorrow night at the stroke of midnight. What does not end is God's plan for us in the new year. Finding the will of God is a lifelong quest, and we need to seek Him first before the details of life come into focus. And when they do, we'll know that we've found the right road. Today: some final thoughts for the last weekday of the year.

Is God's will elusive? Does He try to make it hard to find? As the new year dawns, what lies ahead in the plan of God? The best advice is to take one step at a time. As we are learning, God's will is a series of small events that ultimately take us where He wants us to go.

It is like blank parchment, a new year dawns with no written history. What happens next year is known only to God. That is why it makes a lot of sense to allow God to order our steps in the weeks and months ahead. Today, on the verge of another uncertain new year, you will learn how to let God call the shots of your life. And no one can do it better.

All the presents are open, the wrappings discarded. Soon the tree comes down. But the wonder of Christmas goes on all year long. Believers running life's race know that God sent his only Son to live among us on that pivotal day in Bethlehem. A day marked by a chorus of jubilant angels.

What Angels Celebrate, Part 2 of 3
Christmas marks one of the most pivotal events in human history, the day the Son of God was born. That day was announced by angels. Angels are God's messengers, and the account in the book of Luke tells us that angels were instrumental in making Christ's birth known over the skies of Bethlehem. Royalty was coming into the world, a king who would live and die, and then rise again to return in glory.

Many families gather at Christmas to read the Nativity story from Luke 2, a story marked by the supernatural work of angels. Angels had a joyous task 2,000 years ago, announcing the good news of the Savior's birth. The skies over Bethlehem were ablaze with light, as poor shepherds cowered in fear.

What Angels Know, Part 3 of 3
Modern thinking says angels are benevolent friends looking for ways to help us build our field of dreams. Real angels are far different. God's warriors do His bidding, protect His children, and fight demonic forces in unseen places. The angels always point us to God Himself. They understand what every believer must understand, that God is high and lifted up, seated on the throne of His glory.

Christmas is a great time for angels. You see them in department stores, on Christmas tree branches and on holiday greeting cards. But many people confuse demonic dalliances with real angelic visitations. Today's program will help you understand the difference, a difference that is more crucial than ever, as more and more people are being deceived.

Today, it is OK to believe in angels, especially the kind that make our dreams come true. But beware of these angels. Believers running life's race understand the difference between God's angels and Satan's fallen angels, who seek to deceive us any way they can. Today, we continue a study of angels, and we will move from what they do to what they know.

TV shows, books, and magazines all tell us that angels come to us in disguise to surprise us with wonderful experiences. But believers running life's race know that these "surprises" really come from fallen angels, or demons. Real angels do not have time to give us warm, fuzzy feelings. They have a job to do. They carrying out God's orders and serving as ministering spirits to God's people.

You can read lots of books about people's experiences with angelic beings. The problem is that some of those beings are not angels. Believers know that fallen angels, or demons, do Satan's bidding on planet earth. Real angels serve God, and God alone. We need to know the signs and discern the differences between these beings of darkness and light who inhabit a spiritual realm we cannot see.

Christmas will soon be here, and many of us have an angel on the top of our tree. Pop culture makes much of angels, but who are they? For believers running life's race, God has provided an unseen army of angels, powerful creatures whose duties go far beyond decorating trees. To help us understand who they are, Erwin Lutzer now brings a series called, "A Flurry of Wings."

As the years roll by, one thing always seems to remain the same. This enduring circumstance is that people are always being killed in a war zone. The peace on earth spoken of in the Christmas story will not happen until Jesus sets up his kingdom on earth. He will deliver the whole world from the scourge of war, but when He first came to live among men, few people understood that.

Christ the Deliverer, Part 2 of 3
The people of Jesus' day were under the rule of the Roman Empire, eager for anyone to deliver them from Caesar's yoke. That is why some saw Jesus as the deliverer that had been foretold. They needed a leader to overthrow their oppressors. But Jesus had a larger deliverance to make, a deliverance from the power of sin.

In a Nazareth synagogue, Jesus opened a scroll of Isaiah the prophet and began to read. A hush fell over the people. He read of good news for the poor, freedom for prisoners, sight for the blind, and liberty for the oppressed, ending by saying "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your ears." Only the Son of God could say that.

These days, malls are crowded with bargain-hunters trying to find something for everybody on their Christmas gift list. Traditions have changed drastically from the time of Christ. Through His simple, uncluttered life, He taught us by example how to serve one another. Today we conclude our look at Christ the Servant as foreseen in the writings of Isaiah.

It is not very often that a rich person voluntarily relinquishes his wealth for the sake of those who are less fortunate. Jesus came in poverty that we might be rich. In fact, according to the prophecies of Isaiah, He came as a servant. Today we continue our look at Christ the servant, the one whose life, death and resurrection make Christmas possible.

In general, kings do not do what servants do. They have a retinue of people whose sole job it is to serve the king. Jesus will return one day as King of Kings. But in His first coming He was a servant to the will of God, giving His life to save His people from their sins. Today we begin a look into three chapters of Isaiah, chapters that reveal what kind of servant Jesus was.

Three men visited the young Jesus after His birth. We remember their famous trek by singing the carol, "We Three Kings." In ancient times, Kings had almost absolute power. A person's life or death was in a king's hand. Nowadays, presidents and congresses come and go. Today we will take a look forward to a time of a real king's rule, Jesus on this earth.

Americans have little use for kings. Kings have absolute rule, that is why we declared independence in 1776. Kings have a total claim on people's lives, time, and taxes. We are not used to that these days. We see kings as relics of a bygone era. But today we will see why Christ is the long foretold King of Kings, and what that title means.

When light hits a diamond, the facets reflect brilliantly. We see flashes of color in the radiance of the pure white core. Like a diamond, the purity of Jesus radiates in many facets as we behold His glory. Isaiah gave us names to describe these characteristics in the ninth chapter of his prophecies. Today we take a look at the names ascribed to Christ, and what they mean.

There is a time coming which could not be visualized even with the best high-tech computer graphics software ever devised. The return of Jesus to this earth will be the greatest event of all time for this poor planet's inhabitants. When He comes, He will take action. And those who have loved and served him will be raised from the dead to greet him.

The big difference between those who know Christ and those who do not is that those who do have a glorious future ahead. Jesus will return one day to put an end to the evil running rampant on earth. At that time, those who died in the faith as well as living believers will receive glorious new bodies. Sorrow and pain will be left behind, and eternity will then unfold.

Today we take a final look at "What We Believe", and a peek through the mists of time into the timelessness of eternity.

The church consists of all who have ever believed in Jesus and become members of His body here on earth. Local churches come in many flavors, but there is a universal church destined to be with Jesus in the ages yet to come. Its members are those who recognized their need for a Savior, and then sought to grow in grace and in the knowledge of God.

The Greek word is ekklesia, the "called-out ones." In English, the word is "church," and if you believe in Jesus, you are "called-out." You are called out to live separately from the values of our culture. That is tough to do, but when we forge links of fellowship and support in a local assembly, it becomes a lot easier. That is why God says, "Don't forsake assembling together."

If you examine the evidence, it is clear the devil is having a field day. Evil is running rampant worldwide, but this dominion is only temporary.

Today we will hear about Satan's present activity, and then his ultimate end.

Some religions have two equal and opposing forces in control of the universe. Christianity is not among them. God is in total control, even over anything our enemy Satan does here on earth.

If the devil tempted us in a red suit with horns and a pitchfork, we would laugh. But the real devil is clothed as an angel of light. Even Christians can be deceived and find themselves succumbing to temptation from the enemy of our souls. Satan wants you to think he does not exist. But the Bible tells us that he walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.

Angels often appeared in Bible times with words from God to His people, but angels also brought God's judgment. In doing God's bidding, angels have been charged with watching over believers. In this life we will never know how often they have protected us from harm. Someday we will know, and then we can express our appreciation.

You cannot see them, but they can see you. Angels are ministering spirits, sent to watch over those who believe in Jesus. Angels serve God. Organized in ranks, this myriad of beings do His bidding here on earth. The Bible records many supernatural events, and attributes those events to the work of angels on God's behalf.

Taking a free gift goes against the grain for many people. They would rather earn what they receive, even if it is from God. When it comes to the gospel, no one can do anything to merit salvation. The salvation equation is not Jesus, plus my good deeds, or, plus my good intentions. Only what Jesus did is of value when God the Father bestows eternal life.

The gospel of Christ simply means the good news about Jesus. The good news is His death on the cross that makes our forgiveness possible. It was the risen Christ who commissioned His people to, "go into all the world and make disciples." What is the best way to fulfill that Great Commission? Today we take a further look at how we can make the good news of the Gospel known to those whose eternity depends on hearing it.

The most famous verse in the Bible is John 3:16, which says, "For God so loved the world...." Now that is motivation. The coming of Jesus as a sacrifice for sin made possible the redemption of a lost mankind, so that, as John 3:16 says, "whoever believes in Him might have everlasting life." God was motivated by love to offer his only Son, and that is good news.

That beats cable news any day.

The problem of evil has vexed philosophers since the beginning. The answer that works is not a popular one. The Bible declares that all of humanity is dead in sin, and only the intervention of God can change that proclivity to sin. That is the good news of the gospel, a remedy has been found that can turn a sinner into a saint.

An inherent sickness has stricken the human race. It cannot be denied. Crowded prisons testify to the reality of sin. Those prisons are full of people born in sin, born with a propensity to do wrong. As Paul says, we are all "by nature children of wrath." In our study of key doctrines, we are coming to grips with, "The Sin We Rationalize."

The Sin We Rationalize, Part 2 of 4
God specializes in bringing the dead back to life. He did it for Jesus, and he will do it for everyone who believes in him. The Bible says that, "the soul that sins shall die." Sin is an affront to the holiness of God. Sin leaves us dead, unable to connect with God. The answer? God's redeeming power through the sacrifice of His Son.

The Sin We Rationalize, Part 1 of 4
When you read the Bible, one thing you quickly realize is that God is not tolerant of something called sin. What is sin? It means missing the mark God has set for our behavior. Sadly, many people trivialize sin, even believers. But sin is so serious that God sent his only Son to die as a sacrifice to pay the penalty that ultimate justice demands. Today: a look at sin.

The Spirit We Embrace, Part 4 of 4
One of the ministries of the Holy Spirit is to convict believers of their sins. Our job then is to "cleanse the temple." This is because the Bible teaches that the Spirit dwells in us, and our bodies become His temples. Today we will look at a lesson on keeping a clean house for the Holy Spirit to live in and to enjoy. When this occurs He will have freedom to work in and through our lives.

Why do people tell fibs? This is not the time or place to answer that, but the acronym "FIBS" is helpful for today's program. We're studying the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of a Christian, and "FIBS" provides a way to remember His four key ministries. Today, Erwin Lutzer will tell us what they are, and the difference they should make in your life.

When Jesus promised to send the Holy Spirit to his disciples, he said that the Spirit would soon be "in them." The Bible tells us that the Holy Spirit indwells each believer. The Spirit is as close to us as it is possible to get, so close that Paul gave us an unusual analogy to describe that oneness in 1 Corinthians 6.

Some philosophers acknowledge there must be a God to create all we see, but they say He is distant and not involved with us. But the Bible reveals that God works by the Holy Spirit in the lives of those who believe, providing day-by-day guidance, comfort, wisdom and insight for even the smallest detail of life. Who, or what, is the Holy Spirit?

The Son We Follow, Part 3 of 3
The death of Jesus on a Roman cross has been interpreted in many ways. Some see it as a sad end to a good life. But the Bible tells us that His death was a sacrifice that took the penalty for the sins of the whole world. His obedience in submitting to that death caused God the Father to exalt him to the place that, one day, every tongue will shout, "He is Lord."

The Son We Follow, Part 2 of 3
John's gospel ends with the reason why it was written, that its readers might believe that Jesus is the Son of God and, that believing, they might have life through His name. Jesus was the Christ, the Messiah, the anointed One foretold by the prophets. To understand who Jesus is puts you at the gates of eternal life.

The Son We Follow, Part 1 of 3
God is so vast and incomprehensible that unless He took direct action, we'd never understand Him in a meaningful sense. He took that action two thousand years ago when Jesus Christ appeared on earth. The Bible reveals that Jesus is the Son of God, and that all the fullness of God dwells in Him. Now, to see what God is all about, all we need do is look at Jesus. In this message, we will take that look, a look at "The Son We Follow."

What activity of the Father best describes Him? Is it His vast creation? Many would say it's His redemptive intent. In his series on "What We Believe", Erwin Lutzer is describing "The Father We Worship." The Father has absolute authority blended with immeasurable power. His purposes cannot be thwarted. Those purposes include the plan of redemption He designed and is carrying out.

How can one describe God? How can one describe anything infinite? The best we can do is to list His attributes. In his series on "What We Believe", Erwin Lutzer is describing "The Father We Worship."

Some religions have millions of deities. The Christian faith is based on the self-revelation of a single, omnipotent God. Jesus taught us to call him "Our Father." In the Bible, God has many names, but only one character, a character of absolute holiness combined with infinite power, love, and justice. We will come to grips with "The Father We Worship" in lesson number two of "What We Believe."

The Bible we have is in our hands because many who've gone before us gave their lives so that we could read it. In past centuries, intense persecution followed those who valued the Bible above church tradition. Long the world's best-seller, the Bible commands an allegiance no other book has ever commanded. Some have been martyred for their stand that the Bible alone is the rule of faith.

You are being chased by wolves toward a gorge. A fragile rope bridge spans the gulf. Do you take it, or face the wolves? Dramatic, yes. But this is the bottom line when it comes to the Bible: at some point, your doubts have to give way to faith that it is what it says it is: the Word of God, and the only book that can take you across the gorge of death into eternity.

In this life, we cannot comprehend the transformation that awaits us at the resurrection. It will be a moment of pure glory.

God will reign supreme over a new earth.

At best, life on earth is a mixed bag. We are all dogged by temptation, and our sins slow us in the race of life. But for believers, sin will be no more in the eternity yet to be. With perfect bodies, pain will be no more. With nothing between us and God, our joy will be boundless.

All the money in the world won't keep you alive when it's your turn to die. All people can do with it is buy you a fancier casket. It's folly to live as though life never ends. Believers have a realistic view both of life, and its conclusion. They know that God has for them a life that never ends. We're to glorify God, whether by life or by death.

Those who think there's no God, and that life is the product of random chance, have little hope when it comes to their own death. But those who believe in Jesus know that their times, and their times of death, are in God's hands. Even at that supreme moment, they know they can bring glory to the God who redeemed them.

Even if we get "a new lease on life," that lease will one day expire. We are all on borrowed time: soon, life will end. Believers who know the promises of God count on a life beyond this life. Meanwhile, we live to bring glory to God. Whether our days are many or few, all of us will pass from this life. This message will teach us the how and why of living life in such a way that, when it's over, God receives glory.

How the Glory of God Changes Us, Part 3 of 3
Human nature is a tough thing to change. We develop habits that can be almost impossible to break. But there is one route to transformation. When the Spirit of God indwells a believer, he or she embarks on a journey whose end is being like Christ: transformed from the inside out by the glory of God. This is how a sinner can become a saint and how beholding God leads to our becoming like God.

In the Old Testament, God's glory was only seen by a few. Moses saw it, crying out to see more. We have been redeemed into a the new covenant and under this new promise we can see God's glory. At one point Israel had hard hearts, and Moses had to wear a veil to block God's glory. But Paul wrote that "when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed." Now we can behold, and be changed by, the glory of God.

When Moses came down from the mountain, he had to veil his face. God's glory was making it light up like the sun.

Today: how we can be transformed into God's image when we abandon the hold sin has on our lives.

Job underwent trials that would heavily challenge any of us. Still, he had faith in the ultimate purposes of God. His wife said "curse God and die." But Job persisted until he could say to God, "I had heard of You, but now my eyes have seen you." Despite ten dead children and pain hard to imagine. All of these trials were approved by God. How can we be triumphant in suffering?

Life is no bed of roses. Sooner or later, everybody has pain, or loses a loved one and all of us face the end of life.

We have two letters from the Apostle Paul to the church at Corinth in what is now Greece. Corinth was a moral cesspool. Its pagan temple was filled with prostitutes.

It is said that "what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas," as if moral choices have no consequences. The truth is: that's a lie.

People who misuse sex find the damage extending to every corner of their lives. It's all part of how sex was designed. Sex creates very deep bonds between people, deeper than they realize.

When a runner loses a crucial race, quitting may be a temptation. A good coach helps you pick up the pieces and run again. Believers in life's race run toward our goal: Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our Faith. Like all of us, Peter faltered as he ran. He faltered to the point of amassing a load of guilt too deep for words. Today we will learn how Christ restored a man consumed with regret.

Living Clean In A Dirty World #3 of 3
The world is no friend to the Christian who wants to live a holy life. No matter what we do, some dirt clings to our feet. Believers in the race of life share a daily need to be cleansed by Christ. He desires fellowship with us, fellowship that is broken when we sin. Jesus modeled His teaching by taking a basin and a towel to wash His disciples' feet.

Living Clean In A Dirty World #2 of 3
A basin and a towel are the real symbols of the Christian faith. As Christains we wash each other's feet, and then run life's race. When Jesus washed Peter's feet, the conflict within Peter was palpable. He had a visceral reaction as His Master knelt before him. But servant leadership was on display, and we, like Peter, must heed this poigant demonstration in how to serve.

Living Clean In A Dirty World #1 of 3
When professional runners hear the pistol shot, they are off in a cloud of dust. That dust gets into everything. Just as athletes need to clean their shoes, believers in life's race know they need daily cleansing to please Jesus, the Author and Finisher of their Faith. That is a lesson Peter learned long ago when his Master and Lord washed his feet.

Togetherness With Christ #3 of 3
It has been said that death and taxes are the only two certainties in life. Believers know that there are more than these two temporary dilemmas. We all have financial obligations, and we will all face the end of this life. In Matthew 17, Peter learned a lifelong lesson from a coin in a fish's mouth. This passage reveals the heart of our Father. Believers know that Jesus will be there to meet our needs.

Togetherness With Christ #2 of 3
Object lessons are powerful lessons. Jesus used them many times to communicate vital truth to His disciples. In Matthew 17, Peter learned a lifelong lesson from a coin in a fish's mouth. This lesson revealed to him the source of our provision. Our provider is not distant from our everyday needs. As we too learn that lesson, we will realize how close Christ wants to be to every one of His people.

Many people think Christianity is fine for the life to come, but what about the here and now? How do we respond to everyday issues? Jesus knows full well the race of life we all run. He knows our weaknesses, and He knows what we need. He's aware of the demands each day brings. Through this message, we will join Peter in learning a lesson from a coin in a fish's mouth.

The Cost Of Avoiding The Cross #3 of 3
No one likes the idea of suffering, especially those accustomed to a comfortable lifestyle. And so we avoid the cross. But just as Jesus had to bear His cross on the way to Calvary, He says to each believer: "take up your cross, and follow Me." Had Peter actually dissuaded Jesus from that awful fate, the salvation of mankind would never have been possible.

The Cost Of Avoiding The Cross #2 of 3
Sometimes our best intentions can lead us astray. Peter could not imagine His master nailed to a cross, and told Him so. But Matthew 16 records a stern rebuke from Jesus to Peter: "Get thee behind me, Satan!" Jesus knew that the cross was His destiny, and would not allow anything to stand between Him and the death God had planned from eternity.

The cinder racetrack stretches before you. At the sound of the gun you muster all your effort and leap from the blocks. We run life's race to please Jesus, Who is the Author and Finisher of our Faith. Sometimes though, like Peter, we resist God's leading. That resistance comes with a high price. Today we learn about "The Cost of Avoiding the Cross."

From TV, radio, print, movies, and the internet, a thousand conflicting voices all beckon to us, saying, "follow me." But Jesus said, "My sheep hear My voice, and follow Me." Like Peter of old, we need to realize that the voice of Jesus stands alone as speaking revealed truth. This message will call us to sift through the clutter of voices demanding your allegiance, and listen to the one voice that really matters.

These days, it is fashionable to think of truth as a personal possession: you can have your truth, and I can have my truth. Then we hit the jarring claim of Jesus: "I am the truth." As believers, we need to run life's race conscious that truth is something absolute, not relative, and that truth can be known, not merely guessed at. Today's message will move us from understanding truth as opinion to truth as a person.

Experienced runners stay focused: they know that the only destination that matters is the goal line at the end of the race. Many inviting rabbit-trails try to pull us off the main track. But believers know not to be sidelined by lesser matters. This message will focus on a defining moment for one great believer of old; an moment that set his aim at the goal line, and nowhere else.

The Keys To The Kingdom #3 of 3
The Bible pictures the life of faith as a race course, with believers running down the track, heading for the goal line. Peter's race of life really took off when, in Matthew 16, it was revealed to him that Jesus was the Son of the living God. The same can be true for you and me. Following the crowd is not enough. Like Peter, we must answer "What do you think of Christ?"

Believers know that Christ is the Messiah, but most non-believers are uninterested. Ever wonder what makes the difference? In Matthew 16, Peter is in Caesarea Philipppi. Here he declares that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. Peter did not say this because he was intelligent or wise. There was another reason.

When you buy a house, you get the keys at the real estate closing. Keys signify the right and authority to open the door. One day in northern Israel, in a place called Caesarea Philippi, Peter found himself entrusted with some serious keys, keys handed to him by none other than Jesus Christ.

While Walking On Water, I Sank #3 of 3
We do not learn life's real lessons from a textbook. The lessons that stick are the ones we learn through experience. Peter's stroll on the high seas taught him lessons he would never forget: lessons about the power of God as revealed in Jesus, his new master. And today, we will take home some ways you and I can profit from Peter's unnerving experience.

When you first gaze upon Israel's famous Sea of Galilee, you are impressed with its utter tranquility and peacefulness. But violent winds can arise in a few moments, turning tranquility into terror. On this canvas, the Bible paints a vivid picture of faith coming alive in the midst of upheaval all around.

While Walking On Water, I Sank #1 of 3
From childhood, we all know that heavy objects sink in water. So if someone told you to walk on water, how would you react? One thing Peter and the disciples learned quickly was that Jesus was no ordinary "someone." Christ had command over the laws of nature. This power had never been seen before, and it seemed impossible.

Following The Right Leader #3 of 3
Despite circumstances or what seems logical, at some point every believer must learn to obey God, no matter what. Peter's journey of faith began when Jesus told him, a fisherman, how to fish. The resulting catch proved that obedience to Jesus was the key. Peter would soon learn that Jesus' power to save men is as total as His power to draw fish into a net.

In the army, you learn to follow orders, even when those orders seem illogical. In battle, the chain of command is vital. Sometimes in the race of life we are called to do things that seem, at first, to not make sense. We must do things our experience has not prepared us for. Peter, the veteran fisherman, found himself obeying Christ's unorthodox fishing directive with surprising results.

When you run a race, one thing is critical. You have to keep your eye on who is out in front, the runner who is setting the pace. As believers, we run life's race to please Jesus, Who sets the pace as the Author and Finisher of our faith. He's the leader we're eager to follow. Today: Peter will learn a great lesson from his new Leader, a lesson on trusting beyond his own experience.

Before Peter became a great apostle, he was a simple fisherman. When Christ calls his children, that person's life is forever transformed. We run life's race to please Jesus, Who is the Author and Perfector of our faith. Jesus called Peter from his life by the sea to a life he could never have imagined. For his new task, Peter had to accept a new name from his new Master.

Today we will begin a series on the life of a man who ran his race just like that, a man whose life still towers as a champion for the gospel.

As the light of freedom begins to darken in America, we might become anxious. But, for a moment, consider the Apostle Paul. Paul wrote books of the Bible, while chained to a prison guard. What was his crime? Perhaps the current equivalent is “hate speech.” Erwin Lutzer shares his final thoughts on what we as believers should do when our nation as a whole is leaving God out of its national life.

Tyranny sets in fast when those who lead a nation stop acknowledging their accountability to a higher power. When the U.S. government makes itself the standard by which laws are to be judged, we get laws that contravene not just the Constitution, but also, common sense. Erwin Lutzer explaines why America is fast approaching a cliff of despotism; freedom rapidly being extinguished by those in power.

As America prepares to celebrate another Independence Day, it’s worth asking if we are a nation living in bondage as opposed to freedom. Our failing moral climate is evidence of a nationwide rebellion against God. We are at war with the God who gave this nation liberty in the first place. Signs of decline are all around us. Erwin Lutzer gives a timely look at America as a nation that is rapidly forgetting God.

Whether rich or poor, all of us are equal in one key area. No one has more than twenty-four hours in any given day. Making our time count means spending some of that time in the presence of God. Through prayer we can receive guidance and develop our faith. Then we can navigate the unknowns of life with the One Who knows the end from the beginning.

Waiting for God….it goes against our instincts. When something needs to be done, most of us want to jump in and do it. But waiting for His timing guarantees that things happen at the right time. Waiting for God means investing time every day in prayer: seeking His face, and seeking His direction. Today: how David survived the decade between becoming King and actually being King.

These are days of instantancy. This includes instant coffee, instant internet, instant news. But lots of things in life are not instant. Patience is only developed when that patience is tried. Whether it’s long lines at the grocery or long waits for answered prayer, God uses the unplanned “waits” in our lives to mold our character. Today: we’ll listen to David as he deals with how to handle those times of waiting.

When we conceal sin, we pay a heavy price. The weight of guilt can be crushing, and finding forgiveness is crucial. David expressed his journey toward finding forgiveness in Psalm 32. The process involves total honesty with God and with those we have offended. Today we will look at experiencing the freedom that comes in making things right with both God and man.

It’s the height of folly to think we can hide our sins from God. His gaze can penetrate any attempt to conceal the truth. That’s what David found out, and wrote about in Psalm 32. Caught red-handed in great sin, David came clean before God and man. Today: what it takes to be fully forgiven and restored with the God who can see everything we do.

Deep down, everyone knows that they fall short of moral perfection, and those who have done great wrong really know it. God put a conscience in each one of us, and violating that conscience exacts a high price. Sin has both immediate and long-term consequences, and only being fully forgiven of sin removes the oppression of self-condemnation that wrongdoers feel.

Anyone can rejoice when good things happen, but answer this: can you praise God while lying near death in a hospital? There are many lessons for us in the writings of King David in Psalm 23. One lesson is this: the Good Shepherd is just as with us in bad times as He is in good times. Today: a final look at the Lord as our Shepherd, not just David’s shepherd.

Though named as King, David was pursued by a jealous King Saul for ten long years, forced to hide in caves. While under pursuit, David developed a faith in God’s purposes that enabled him to write “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.” How many of us face our trials with that kind of confidence?

When God wanted us to understand how He cares for us, He gave us the picture of a shepherd tending his flock. Shepherds…they do much more than guide their sheep to sources of food and water. They take a personal interest in every sheep, providing correction to insure that animal’s well-being. Today: we’re going to look into the writings of David, the shepherd turned king.

The Eleventh Commandment #3 of 3
The race of life is hard when our labors are not fueled by the love of God. That’s why Jesus gave His great commandment. Loving God with all our hearts, and our neighbors as ourselves, fulfills the law and pleases our Creator. Obeying this commandment means obeying all ten of the ones God wrote on tablets of stone to give to Moses so long ago.

The words of Jesus are simple, yet penetrating. The command to “Love your neighbor as yourself” is one such challenge. Winners in life’s race learn to obey the greatest commandment: loving God, and loving our neighbors. This takes supernatural power, since our natural inclination is to love only ourselves. Today, more on the lifelong process of learning to love God and others.

Did you know that wanting what someone else has is idolatry? In God’s view, you might as well bow down before a false deity. Those who win in the race of life obey God’s commandment against covetousness, relying on God to meet their needs as He sees fit. For true winners, the allure of what others have will fade into the assurance of God’s provision.

We know it the minute we do it. Lying causes our consciences to twinge with pain. And lying leads to more lies. You can’t win in the race of life when you don’t tell the truth. God made it plain in Commandment number nine: do not bear false witness. Whether it’s a “little white lie” or a real whopper, any falsehood breaks this commandment.

In a list of seven things God hates, the writer of Proverbs lists lying - twice. That’s top billing for a sin we all commit. Winning the race of life requires honesty. As we explore the ninth of the Ten Commandments, we’ll see why this sin is so prevalent, and so destructive. Imagine you’re in court. Will you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

For some reason, we humans make a distinction between big lies and little lies. To us, telling a “white lie” is OK. Believers running the race of life need to tell the truth if they want to win.

Whether it’s blue collar or white collar, the bottom line is that stealing from your company means you’re wearing a guilty collar. Whether we steal office supplies, or an employer’s time, stealing violates a prime directive from God. The eighth commandment tells us to respect the property rights of others. God takes note when we fail to do so. Today: more about this eighth commandment.

Most people say “What’s mine is mine, what’s yours is yours.” But then there are those who say “what’s yours is mine.” It’s more than bank robberies and burglary. People steal from their employers with hardly a second thought. We seem to forget that stealing any private property violates one of the Ten Commandments. And that’s our focus on today’s Running to Win.

It’s dangerous to get too close to a fire. And, to get too close to a possible sexual sin. The price is too high. That’s why the seventh commandment teaches us to avoid all forms of sexual sin. That means faithfulness to the wife or husband God gives us. The result: a life free from the entanglements that can stop us in our tracks.

It’s like throwing kerosene on a fire. Sexual temptation grabs tightly and won’t let go. Fighting it takes commitment. Most of us have lifetime mates with whom to enjoy sexual intimacy. But straying from that mate is a deadly sin, expressly forbidden by one of the Ten Commandments. Today: we learn about the high price of adultery.

Each of us has a strong desire for intimacy. But keeping our sex drives under control is one of our biggest challenges. Runners in the race of the Christian life know that sex in it’s proper place is a great gift, while passions out of control can ruin one’s future. That’s why God gave us commandment number seven. It’s still in force, even in a sex-mad culture.

God says human life is so sacred that if innocent life is taken, the perpetrator must die. It’s not a matter for debate. As Creator, God sets the rules. He decreed that murder violates one of His prime commandments and must be repaid accordingly. And since our justice system often fails to do this, life loses the value God has placed upon it.

The Value Of Life #2 of 3
There’s something final about murder. Taking a life means there’s no way back. God views murder very seriously. At the bedrock of the Law of God is the prohibition against taking innocent life. Yet hundreds of people are killed every year in each of our major cities. Life is cheap, and gets cheaper when convicted killers never pay the price God commanded.

The Value Of Life #1 of 3
There’s one sure way to stop someone else from running life’s race. And that’s to do what we see on TV countless times every night. Murder: it’s now so common that we aren’t fazed by it much anymore. But the taking of innocent life breaks one of the cardinal commandments of God. And since Roe versus Wade, that commandment has been broken untold millions of times.

What Sunday Should Mean To You #3 of 3
The principle of resting one day in seven is as old as creation and as foundational as the fourth of the Ten Commandments. We, like athletes, need rest, and God commanded that we should take that rest every week. The question is, should it be on Saturday or Sunday? And do the regulations of the Jewish Sabbath carry over to Sunday?

What Sunday Should Mean To You #2 of 3
Every athlete knows that the body cannot be run indefinitely. We labor, and then we rest. That’s how we’re designed. God made it clear that all of us need to observe a day of rest. The concept is so important that he made it into one of the Ten Commandments. Now, Sunday is just another day to shop, work, or be on the move: not a day for reflection, meditation and prayer.

What Sunday Should Mean To You #1 of 3
A century ago, British Olympian Eric Liddell shocked the world by refusing to run on Sunday. The royal family was furious. Eric was made famous in the movie “Chariots of Fire,” holding fast to his conviction that the Lord’s Day was sacred, and not to be used for sport. These days, many of us look forward to Sunday football games. Have we gone off track?

The Misuse Of God's Name #3 of 3
When someone sues you for slander, you might be fined for defaming a good name. But what’s the penalty for slandering God? The commandment to not take His name in vain goes to the core of His nature, and to the heart of respecting Him as Creator. Today: some pointed lessons we can take home from another of the Ten Commandments.

The Misuse Of God's Name #2 of 3
When famous celebrities’ names are dragged into the mud, they sue for slander. They know the value of a good name. But those who worry about their names are often careless in how they use God’s name. Whether by intention or not, the Lord’s name is misused millions of time every day. Still, God holds His name in such high regard that He made a commandment that it not be taken in vain.

The Misuse Of God's Name #1 of 3
Many Olympic stars hope to make names for themselves with their gold medals. A winning name can mean a lot of money. Runners in the race of the Christian life know that God’s name is holy, and is not to be misused by swearing, cursing, or improper oath-taking. Keeping His name set apart was so important to God that He wrote a command about it with His finger on a tablet of stone.

Ensnared By Images #3 of 3
Idol worship: for many in ancient times, it’s carved figures of wood or stone. The modern equivalent: TV images, money, success. Runners in the race of the Christian life need to know that God’s prohibition of graven images was for our own good as well as for His glory. Any image of God becomes an idol, and God is dead-set against idolatry. How serious is this? Stay with us.

Ensnared By Images #2 of 3
God said, “I am the Lord, that is My name. My glory I will not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.” No ambiguity there. It’s clear that God will not tolerate the worship of images. But does that mean crosses, crucifixes, or icons? Some people find these objects very meaningful. Do they violate God’s commandment?

We humans like pictures. We all have them in our wallets, on our walls, on our computer screens. But is a picture ever wrong? Runners in the race of life need to understand God’s commands that prohibit images meant to represent Him. People disobey this commandment daily, giving their worship to a vast array of idols, carvings, pictures, and icons. Why is this wrong?

It’s in the nature of man to worship something, even deities made of wood and stone, or, money, technology, and power. But God makes it clear that we humans have a Creator Who will not tolerate any idols, even ourselves. Today: more about why a jealous God’s first commandment requires that nothing replace Him in our allegiance.

In Competition With God #2 of 3
“You shall have no other gods before Me.” That’s a rule God has laid down for every man, woman, and child on earth. God rightfully demands our full allegiance and focus. “No competition is allowed,” according to the first of the Ten Commandments. Yet people today worship almost anything except the true God who made them, and the result is moral chaos.

In Competition With God #1 of 3
On the racetrack, competition is everything. You run to beat your opponents, and to break records others have set before you. There’s one area in which God tolerates no competition. He wants to be supreme in our lives, and He made that clear by writing on a tablet of stone the first of the Ten Commandments. It’s commandment number one for a reason.

Thunder From Sinai #3 of 3
We know the laws of nature don’t change, the speed of light is fixed. But we forget the reality of a moral law just as certain. Running life’s race successfully means following God’s moral laws, as laid out in The Ten Commandments, a code given to Moses that reveals first God’s holiness, and then our need for His grace.

According to the law of gravity, when you drop a stone, it falls to the ground. On this earth, that law is immutable. Those who run life’s race know that God’s moral law has the same force. The commandments He gave to Moses define His character, and His expectations of our behavior. Today we will learn that God’s moral law shows us who we really are.

Athletes know that fixed principles govern their success. Follow them, and you can win. Ignore them, and you will lose. The great moral code God gave to Moses contains principles governing our relationships with God and with each other. That code shows us who we are, and more importantly, who God is. Today, we begin a series on The Ten Commandments.

Jesus, Lord Of Death #3 of 3
When Jesus was preparing to raise Lazarus from the grave, He wanted there to be no mistake that Lazarus was indeed dead. That’s why He waited four days before displaying His power and glory in calling Lazarus from the grave. Jesus specializes in giving new life to those dead in their sins and separated from God. Today: why you and I should believe.

Jesus, Lord Of Death #2 of 3
Jesus used miracles to teach lessons to those around Him. Perhaps His greatest lesson involved a man named Lazarus. First, He allowed His sick friend to die. Then He raised Lazarus from the dead to show that He is indeed “the resurrection and the life.” And without that kind of life, there really is no living at all.

Our greatest fear is death. Our greatest pain is when loved ones die. A friend’s death caused Jesus to weep. In a display of power and glory that shook creation, Jesus cried out “Lazarus, come forth!” Today: we’ll see why the risen Christ is the Lord of Death and how He holds the keys of life and death for everyone who has ever lived.

One thing we can learn from the healing of a man born blind is that God has a bigger purpose in mind than we can imagine. Jesus used this healing as evidence of a larger mission: to bring spiritual sight to the spiritually blind, and blindness to those who think they can see. Today: the lessons we can take home from a dramatic story of supernatural power.

Jesus healed a blind man’s eyes. Many today yearn for healing as well, and turn to faith-healers for deliverance. The healing works of Christ were complete. “Once I was blind, but now I can see.” Can the same be said for the miracles of modern-day televangelists? Today: lessons from the Great Physician on miracles of healing. Please stay with us.

People should have rejoiced: a blind man received his sight. Yet this miracle caused more controversy than celebration. The compassion of Christ on a disabled man led to a big squabble among local religious leaders. Today: human nature is on display….rather than uniting them, this great miracle divided people into factions based on their preconceptions. Stay with us.

One of the toughest questions we can ask is: why does God allow some people to be born with severe disabilities? Most of us run life’s race with little or no disability. But others have to run that race without sight, without working limbs, or with other impairments. Today: we will hear one reason why this happens, taken from the lips of Jesus Himself.

Do severe trials mean you’ve left the will of God? Not always. Jesus sent His disciples onto a storm-tossed sea. God uses storms to mold our character, and our job is to hold on to our faith in Christ no matter what. Sometimes, God leads His people into the tempest to teach them what cannot be taught in comfort. Today: lessons from some wind-whipped water.

Sudden squalls often hit the Sea of Galilee. One minute it’s calm: the next, a storm is tossing you out of your boat. Life is like that. One day, all is well. The next a terrible accident, a sudden death, financial catastrophe. Today we learn a few lessons from the one person Who can either calm the storm, or, calm His fretful children.

Most of us believe in the unchanging laws of nature: light things float, heavy things sink. But that is not always true. To calm His disciples’ fears, Jesus decided to overrule the usual laws of nature. He walked on water, and later commanded a storm to cease. If you’d been in that boat, what would your reaction have been?

The kinds of miracles most of us want are only temporary ones. If we’re healed of cancer, we will still die one day. Jesus fed the 5,000 by the Sea of Galilee to underscore their desperate need of Him as the eternal Bread that can feed their souls. We, too, need to seek Him, and not only His miracles. Our real hunger is to know God, and Jesus delights in meeting that need.

Food never tastes as good as it does when you’re really hungry. Jesus knew this when He miraculously fed the 5,000. He later spoke to the crowd about Himself as the Bread of Life, encouraging the spiritually hungry to believe in Him. Today: why we need eternal bread, and where to find it: from the same hands that multiplied the loaves and fishes.

As huge crowds began to follow Jesus, He did a great miracle which showed both His power and His compassion. Many books have been written about the feeding of the 5,000 near the shore of the Sea of Galilee. Today: why this miracle should convince everyone that Jesus is Lord.

The early miracles of Jesus were private. Later, they became public. One day, over 5,000 were fed from a boy’s lunch. Generally in life there are no free lunches. But this day was different, and the news of this incredible miracle spread like wildfire. Today: the story of multiplied loaves and fishes, and what it means to us.

Jesus, Lord Of Our Impossibilities #3 of 3
It’s interesting how Jesus tied obedience to receiving a miracle. “Get up and walk!” He told the paralyzed man. In most cases, the miracle happened as the needy person obeyed. Perhaps many of us desire a miracle more than we desire to be obedient to the God who can grant the miracle. Today we learn a few lessons from a healing at the Pool of Bethesda.

If you were lame for thirty-eight years, you’d do anything to be healed. But if a man says “get up and walk,” you might just stare. When Jesus did miracles, He sometimes asked the impossible. Today: how Jesus can do the impossible in your life, and mine, and why we have a very real part to play in seeing the impossible come to pass. Stay with us.

If you have a great need, and you’ve had it for a long time, you may have given up all hope that your need will ever be met. As runners in life’s race, we may face impossible situations. That is, unless the Lord of the impossible does a miracle. The Bible teaches that all things are possible with God. And today: we’ll see Jesus do the impossible.

In times of crisis, we cry out to God….like the man in Jesus’ day who saw his crisis faith become contagious faith. Jesus did many miracles to display His glory and encourage our belief. We too can have contagious faith, faith that takes Christ at His word. Today: lessons we can learn from a long-distance healing 2,000 years ago.

Soldiers in war know all about foxhole conversions. That’s crisis faith: you cry out to God when there’s no other choice. The miracles of Jesus teach us to move beyond crisis faith. He wants us to trust Him no matter what. Today: a man whose faith soared: a man who believed what Jesus said without any immediate evidence.

Many people who seek miracles today travel to shrines or large public meetings. In Jesus’ day, that wasn’t necessary. His miracles transcended time and space. He spoke, and it was done, whether right in front of Him or fifty miles away. Today: the power and glory of miracles done at a distance.

We’ve all heard the expression “good things come to them that wait.” That was never more true than it was at a simple Jewish wedding. When Jesus turned water into wine as the wedding party was nearing its end, he took the least and made it into the best. Today: more about Christ’s first miracle at Cana, one of many proving He was and is the Son of God.

It is not every day that water is turned into the finest wine. Word soon spread that Jesus was no ordinary man. Jesus specializes in turning the common into the uncommon: water into wine, and sinners into saints.

It was a small wedding in a small town. When the wine ran out, a typical wedding quickly became very untypical. Jesus emerged as a wedding guest, from anonymity, by performing His first public miracle. That day, gallons of water were turned into the sweetest of wines. Veteran tasters there rated the result: “wow.”

People who say they’ve made a decision for Christ may not realize that, in reality, God made a decision first. No human decision can create a new heart in a sinner. The one who bestows new hearts is God, and when He does, the result is nothing less than a miracle. Today: why the new birth is God reaching down, not man reaching up.

To win a major race, runners lose extra weight. They cast off everything that might slow them down on their way to victory. Believers are commanded to love God supremely, and cast off every weight and sin that besets them. Then, they can run life’s race at top speed, knowing that the goal line will bring them face to face with the God they love.

First place, the thought of winning a race drives athletes to excel….to give their all to cross the goal line first. Believers are to give God first place in their lives, running life’s race for no other reason than to express their love for Him. In fact, we’re commanded to love God supremely: everything else is to take second place.

At the racetrack, a runner is driven by the thought of victory. The race is worth all the effort when the prize awaits at the end. Believers are to run life’s race for Christ, who taught us to love God with all our being as the first and greatest commandment. Now that’s a tall order, one we’ll explore today on our broadcast.

Christ, The Lord Of Our Finances #3 of 3
When a man or woman is converted to Christ, many deep-seated desires change. We become givers rather than takers and God’s desire is that we see our money as a trust to manage, not a possession to squander. Running life’s race successfully has a financial component: a component we’ll summarize on today’s broadcast.

Christ, The Lord Of Our Finances #2 of 3
Money. You can’t live without it, and sometimes you can’t live with it. Believers in the race of life need to come to grips with money. And that means discerning God’s intentions for our pocketbooks. Many of us grip those pocketbooks until our knuckles turn white. But God wants us to discover the joy of generosity, and that’s our focus on today’s broadcast.

“The love of money is the root of all evil.” Christians running the race of life frequently get tripped up by matters of money. And those issues revolve around ownership. Whose money is it really? Is it mine to do with as I please, or am I just taking care of it for someone else? Christ had much to say about money: words we will hear shortly.

Not all of us can win the hundred-meter dash. But all of us can run to the best of our ability. That’s all a coach can expect. For every track star in the Olympics, there are thousands of runners who will never make the team. But that’s no reason to give up. Many believers with few talents approach life with a clenched fist rather than an open hand.

Remember high school gym class? Perhaps you never did well in those track events, but the coach kept urging you to do your best. Although we are not equal in abilities, we are equal in our obligation to use our abilities for God wisely. In Bible times, a talent was a large sum of money. Today it signifies an ability. Either way, the parable of the talents shows us how to manage what we’ve got.

We’re not all made the same. Some are more talented than others. But all believers run life’s race toward a heavenly goal. We are all given gifts and abilities. But it’s how we use them, not how many we’ve got, that determines the outcome of our race. Rather than complain about what we don’t have, let’s focus today on how to best use what we have been given.

Christ, The Lord Of Our Time #3 of 3
At the race track, coaches watch athletes with stopwatches in hand. Because for a runner, time is how victory is measured. The same is true for Christians in life’s race. How we use our time determines our effectiveness for God. At the end of this life, we’ll be judged on our deeds...deeds that took place as the clock ticked off the minutes, days, and years.

Christ, The Lord Of Our Time #2 of 3
Track and field athletes get very familiar with the stopwatch. Their training is a regimen to improve their times, until they win. For the Christian, time is a vital, non-renewable resource. Like a coin, it can only be spent once. How we spend it requires wisdom from God. Why not invest the next fifteen minutes learning how to best use your time?

Christ, The Lord Of Our Time #1 of 3
In a race, no time can be wasted. Runners pace themselves, knowing that winners only win by a fraction of a second. For Christians running the race of life, the clock is also relentless. Once gone, time cannot be reclaimed. The Bible teaches believers to be “redeeming the time, for the days are evil.” Time must be used wisely every day.

At the end of all things is a man on a white horse. It’s said he is faithful and true; with justice he judges. Jesus is the one on that white horse. When the last chapter of planet earth is written, it will be about Him. Today we learn of the end of all things, and the beginning of all things new.

All great dramas build toward a conclusion. The drama of redemption began in Eden and ends with new heavens and a new earth. All the plot elements are wrapped up in a glorious resolution: the enemies of Christ are vanquished, the rebellious are judged, and the redeemed find themselves on streets of gold in the New Jerusalem. Today: we are nearing the finale to the grand plan God set in motion before the world began.

There is one book in the Bible that guarantees a blessing to all who read it. It’s the very last book: the Book of Revelation. Written in apocalyptic language rich in symbolism, Revelation portrays the future yet to be, including the glorious return of Jesus, the resurrection of the dead, the judgments, the Millenial reign, and then, the eternity which follows.

The New Testament Part 1 #3 of 3
After Israel’s last prophet faded from the scene, it got real quiet for 400 years in terms of direct revelation. Some at the time might have asked if God intended to carry out His redemptive plan. But the timing was impeccable, as a young baby was born, ushering in a new age of spiritual revelation. That new age brought us a New Testament, the book we are flying through right now.

The New Testament Part 1 #2 of 3
If the drama of redemption were a play, it would have two acts, set in the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. The central theme - the bringing together of God and man through a sacrifice atoning for the sins that separated the two. In the Old Testament, that was done using animals at the Temple in Jerusalem. The New Testament reveals the real sacrifice that takes away sin.

The New Testament Part 1 #1 of 3
In the drama of redemption, the Old Testament is a grand prologue. In the New Testament, the great transaction takes place. A sacrifice for the sins of all mankind is offered on a cross outside the city of Jerusalem. Jesus gives his life not far from where Abraham almost offered his son Isaac. No playwright could dream of a story so bold, so loving, and so wonderful.

The Old Testament Part 2 #3 of 3
Behind all the history we read about in the Bible lies the purpose of God: to provide redemption for those that believe. The nation Israel had one reason for being: to bring forth a Messiah who would first die as a sacrifice for sin, and later be raised to return one day as king over all the earth. He will rule from Jerusalem, site of the temple sacrifices that pointed to His ultimate sacrifice.

Times of blessing, times of disobedience, times of judgment; Israel went through many such cyles in its long history. After seventy years of captivity, the people were allowed to return home. And that’s where we’ll pick up the story in today’s edition of The Drama of Redemption: the unfolding saga of how God made salvation possible through a people, a Messiah, and a great sacrifice.

It is the kind of stuff that fascinates us when we watch The History Channel. It is the story of the nation of Israel. The Old Testament is many things: prophecy, history, law, and wisdom literature such as Psalms and Proverbs. Today we’re continuing our jet-plane flyover of the Old Testament, and we’ll focus on the time period when Israel was taken into capitivity: its temple destroyed.

Nations rise and fall over high taxes. Ancient Israel split in two when Solomon’s son Rehoboam jacked up the rates. Ten tribes revolted and Jeroboam became their king, ruling in the north. In the south, two tribes formed a separate kingdom of Judah. What all this means in the great Drama of Redemption is our focus on today’s fast-moving edition of Running to Win.

When people pick up the Bible for the first time, it can be a daunting experience. The big question is: "where do I begin?” If you want a big-picture view of the whole Bible, you’ve come to the right place. We’re exploring The Drama of Redemption, giving a quick overview of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. Today: more of the Old Testament will fly past us, so listen closely.

Theologians like big words, like “proto-evangelium,” which means “first gospel,” found in Genesis 3:15. Redemption did not begin when Jesus appeared on earth. God’s gracious plan of salvation is evident even in the Garden of Eden. This famous verse depicts a promised redeemer who would one day crush Satan’s head. Today: more of the Drama of Redemption.

Imagine the earth as a grand stage. Here, a great drama is continually being played out. But this play is for real. The sins of mankind separated us from our Creator. But God was not content to let his finest creation die with no hope. He set in motion a plan to redeem those that believe in the value of a great sacrifice: that of Jesus on the cross.

When Loyalties Collide #3 of 3
We can still enjoy July 4th, but for many Christians, the liberties we celebrate are now being sharply curtailed. Under pressure from agenda-driven groups, what was once free speech is now a federal crime. In the public schools, tax money is used to indoctrinate our kids in the homosexual lifestyle. Is there a time to stand up and say “no?” Erwin Lutzer says “yes.”

Someone has said that nothing is certain except death and taxes.&nbsp; Throughout all of history, governments have been taking your money. In Jesus’ day, tax collectors were despised. After all, they took Jewish cash and gave it to the hated Roman occupiers. The wisdom of Jesus was never more clear than when he answered the question of who owes what to whom.

For a long time, Christians could comfortably wave the American flag, since their values were represented in “Old Glory….” Now the government is repressing the freedoms Christians once had, favoring the agendas of those desiring same–sex marriage and unrestricted abortion. When the red, white and blue no longer blends with the cross of Christ, what do believers do?

When cars collide, the tangled wreckage can soon be cleared. But when people collide, the wreckage can be life-long. The story of mankind is a saga of conflict, and only a supernatural intervention of God can heal the wounds we inflict on each other. Today, Erwin Lutzer tells how one man resolved a lifetime of hatred within his own family.

Like snowflakes, no two people are alike. Our differences bring great variety, but they can also plant seeds of conflict. Each of us is wired from birth to put self first. Only the spirit of God can smooth the rough edges and help us extend ourselves in blessing to others. Today, Erwin Lutzer tells the story of a cab driver with a horrid past, a man who needed a friend.

As someone once said, “The church is wonderful….I love the church...itrsquo;s the people in the church that I just can’t stand” Well, we are not in the Garden of Eden anymore. Frictions can occur even between believers, as disagreements and personal agendas rise to the surface. Today, Erwin Lutzer exposes a not-so-secret secret: Christians do not always get along.

It’s like going to an ice cream shop. If you’re looking for what church  to attend, there are lots of flavors available. LiteralIy hundreds of  denominations and internal sub-denominations reflect often contradictory  versions of the Christian faith. Today, Erwin Lutzer helps us sort  through the complexity and key in on what really matters when selecting a  local assembly of believers to join.

Some critics of Christianity look at its thousands of denominations and splinter groups that call themselves Christian and they wonder “where is the unity is that Jesus talked about.” There’s no doubt that opinions and Bible interpretations vary widely. So how should a believer handle the fact that the faith is represented in so many different ways?

Persecution of Christians is on the way up in America, giving today’s believers a taste of what the early church had to face. The word of God gives clear direction on how Christians should to respond to an antagonistic culture. It also tells us how not to respond. Today, Erwin Lutzer summarizes how to live in a godly way in an increasingly godless society.

There’s no doubt: Christians are under attack. The media and current culture combine to belittle those with faith in Jesus. So how should genuine believers react? Nowadays it seems easier to keep a low profile, go quietly to church, and not make a fuss. But this is hardly obeying the Great Commission. Today: another look at the conflicts inherent in being a child of God these days.

Many Americans wonder why our troops are dying in Afghanistan. They say there’s nothing over there worth dying for. There was a time when there were things worth dying for, times like the middle ages, when corrupt religion was confronted by true believers who often paid with their lives. Conflict is inevitable, as much as we would like to “just get along,” there come times when we cannot.

America has been called a melting pot of cultures and races, for sure, and these days, it’s a melting pot for religions. Trouble is, varying religions don’t melt together very well. Despite America’s Judeo-Christian roots, it’s now necessary to censor the Ten Commandments even when they hang over courtroom benches. Today: a story of conflict, and how to handle it.

Death To Self-Justification #4 of 4
The hymnwriter penned these words: “let your heart be broken for a world in need.” Friend, is your heart broken? Jonah preached in Ninevah only after God had to literally drag him there. Was his heart ever broken by that which breaks the heart of God? Today: final lessons we can take home from the story of a disobedient prophet.

Creature comforts: we all love them. If it’s hot outside, we crank up the air conditioner. If it’s cold, we turn up the heat. Some people feel that their well-being is a constitutional right. They feel we deserve all the best life can provide. Jonah’s experience with a shady plant in the desert teaches us this: there are more important things than how we feel. Today: let’s get our priorities straight.

One lesson we learn from the story of Jonah is that God is as concerned with our motivations as He is with our actions. After Jonah preached, he got angry and depressed. Then God sent a sequence of events into Jonah’s life to teach his wayward prophet some pointed object lessons. Today: the story of a plant, a worm, and a scorching east wind.

When someone you know is having a pity party, it’s no fun. It’s usually not a party anybody really wants to attend. Jonah finally obeyed God, but took no joy in the revival that followed his preaching in Ninevah. His self-focus prevented him from seeing the big picture. Instead, he sat down, asking God that he might die. Pity party indeed!

Some of God’s servants have to go to school: and that’s the school of hard knocks before they learn to obey God from the heart. And some never learn. Jonah went to Ninevah, but only after some tough correction from the Lord. Still, his heart was hard; he had no real concern for the people of a great pagan city. So, are we serving God for the right reasons?

Many of us have dogs who won’t do what they’re told. Only when put on a leash will they go where we want them to go. But then the dog puts out his paws and puts on the brakes, trying to avoid the inevitable until we pull hard enough to get the point across. Jonah finally preached to the Ninevites, but only through clenched teeth. Do we ever fight God this way?

Everybody has an agenda these days, especially politicians. “Looking out for number one:” hey, that’s a national pastime. God wants His servants focused on God’s agenda, and not their own. It’s taken some extraordinary measures to get Jonah back on the road to Ninevah, but now he’s going, in body if not in heart. Today: Jonah’s lessons continue, as do ours.

When things are going well, people have little sense of a need for God. It’s the tough times that show us our true condition. Sometimes, circumstances overwhelm us, forcing us to turn to God for a way out. Jonah was certainly overwhelmed in the belly of a great fish. For Jonah, that experience truly marked his “Death to Self-Reliance.” Perhaps the same result lies ahead for you and me.

Have circumstances ever brought you to the end of your rope? They did for Jonah, who found himself in the belly of a fish. God has amazing ways of getting us to say yes. He does not make us puppets; rather, He arranges conditions so that we will choose to do His will. Sometimes those conditions can be tough, and they stay that way until we submit to God’s authority.

It’s common to hear people explain the gospel as if being saved is a decision a sinner can make whenever he or she chooses. But the story of Jonah provides clear evidence that God is the one making the choices. God appointed a fish to swallow the prophet…later, He appointed a scorching east wind. Today: let’s find out who’s really in charge, and whose purposes cannot be thwarted.
